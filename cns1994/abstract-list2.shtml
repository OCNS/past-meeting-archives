      <p><b>Title:</b> PARTIAL AND FULL SYNCHRONY IN THE RE DURING SPINDLE OSCILLATIONS</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> We address through modeling the hypothesis of Steriade and colleagues that 
      the Reticular Thalamic Nucleus (RE) is the generator of spindle oscillation. Each model neuron 
      exhibits post-inhibitory rebound and is coupled to all the other neurons via GABAA and GABAg 
      inhibitory synapses. An isolated network of identical RE cells typically exhibits partial 
      synchrony as it segregates itself into clusters; each neuron tends to burst only every two or 
      more cycles of the population voltage. Blocking the GABAA synapses or increasing their reversal 
      potential can produce a fully synchronized network. Excitation from thalamocortical cells 
      results in synchronized oscillations that are robust to heterogeneity and noise.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> A HEBBIAN RULE CONSISTENT WITH PHYSIOLOGY AND PRODUCING SHARP REFINEMENT OF 
  	  ORGANIZATION</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Although the popular quadratic Hebbian rules lead to successful models of 
      plasticity and learning, they are inconsistent with physiology. We developed a new rule based on 
      the increase of presynaptic release following messenger feedback from the postsynaptic site. 
      This rule was analyzed mathematically for the case of one and two synapses, and computationally 
      for larger numbers of synapses. The results indicate its consistency with long-term potentiation 
      and depression phenomenology, and better refinements of organization than obtained with 
      quadratic rules. Hence, although mathematically less treatable, physiological rules might 
      produce better organization and learning than quadratic rules. Supported by the NEI (EY08921)

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> ANALYSIS OF A STOCHASTIC MODEL OF SOMATOSENSORY INFORMATION PROCESSING.</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> This work analyzes a neural network model of somatosensory information 
      processing with additive noise. The response, as measured by metabolic activity of cortical 
      tissue(2-DG), is examined. The model is a network of aggregated neural units, governed by a 
      system of coupled p.d.e's. The coupling coefficients are identical for all units in the network, 
      each with a self-excitation, lateral inhibition pattern. Both the linear and non-linear models 
      are investigated. The results of computer experiments on a difference equation version of the 
      model are presented. The simulations agree well with previous work, showing the formation of a 
      steady state, spatially inhomogeneous pattern in response to constant stimulus for weak lateral 
      inhibition. The dynamics of steady state formation and its qualitative characteristics are not 
      affected by the addition of noise. Strong inhibition leads to unstable behavior of the network. 
      Results of computer experiments serve as a basis for the theoretical analysis of the model 
      dynamics. A stability criterion for the connection patterns in the linear and sigmoidal network 
      is developed, thereby extending previous work.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> DEVELOPMENT OF CORTICAL SEGREGATES BY THE COMPETITIVE DISTRIBUTION OF 
  	  ACTIVATION</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Recently, an alternative to the continuous, somatotopic representation of 
      body surface has been proposed. In this proposal, cortical organization is described as a 
      mosaic of discrete segregates which tile the cortical surface and encode spatiotemporal 
      properties of the incoming sensory data. A segregate is defined by the following 
      characteristics: all the maximal receptive fields (RFs) of the neurons comprising the segregate 
      have a single skin region in common, termed the scgrcgatc RF ccntcr, and this center is 
      non-overlapping with other segregates' centers. This paper presents a model of development of 
      this organization via an adaptation of the competitive distribution of activation model. We 
      propose a model to simulate segregate development via two learning mechanisms; the first being a 
      Hebbian learning rule to facilitate cooperation of units within a segregate, and the second 
      being a competitive learning rule which alters RF morphology eo discretize cortical 
      organization.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> CODING FOR GLOBAL PARAMETERS MAY BE CARRIED BY SYNCHRONISED SUBCORTICAL 
  	  OSCILLATIONS</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Much attention has recently been given to fast oscillations in the visual 
      system. We believe these dynamical states may carry sensory information. In order to investigate 
      this possibility, we performed multi-site single neuron and unit cluster recordings in the 
      subcortical visual system, specifically: the optic tract (OT), pretectal area, superficial gray 
      layer of the superior colliculus (SGS), and the lateral geniculate (LGN) thalamic nucleus in 
      awake and anaesthetised rats. Spontaneous, highly synchronised oscillations from single unit and 
      unit cluster activity approximating 10, 20, and 40Hz were recorded in all of these areas, lower 
      frequencies predominating in deeper anaesthesia. Autocorrelation histogram studies reflect very 
      high coherence of the oscillations, in one case showing a temporal coherence for approximately 8 
      secs.</p>
      <p>A frequency study was performed on awake vs. anaesthetised rats via chronic implantation of a 
      multi-wire array in the SGS of the rat. Cross correlation histograms from the multi-unit, 
      multisite recordings in the anaesthetised paradigm reveal synchronous oscillations approximating 
      20 Hz. Cross correlation histograms from the same multi-site recordings in the same rat under 
      awake conditions show oscillatory frequency approximating 25 Hz. In general we noticed that 
      while the animal was deeply anaesthetised, approximately 10 Hz frequencies were prevalent in 
      younger rats, while 20 Hz frequencies prevailed in older ones. In all cases one, sometimes two, 
      frequency bifurcations occurred as the effects of anaesthesia wore off. A spectrum analysis of 
      the data shows that all of these frequencies (ie. 10, 20, and 40 Hz) may coexist within the same 
      data set, exhibiting spontaneous bifurcations in upper harmonics of 10 Hz. Such frequency 
      transitions are reminiscent of nonlinear dynamical systems which exhibit similar sudden 
      bifurcations.</p>
      <p>These oscillations were shown to be retinally derived by the following: 1) they were 
      abolished by contralateral enucleation, 2) simultaneous recordings from similar locations across 
      opposite colliculi revealed asynchronous activity between the two SGS, 3) multi-fiber recordings 
      from the OT revealed oscillations</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> FEEDBACK REGULATION OF CHOLINERGIC MODULATION AND HIPPOCAMPAL MEMORY 
  	  FUNCTION</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Acetylcholine may set the appropriate dynamics for learning within the 
      hippocampal formation. A model of the feedback regulation of cholinergic modulation in 
      hippocampal regions CA 1 and CA3 was developed, focusing on the putative autoassociative and 
      heteroassociative memory function of synapses arising from CA3 pyramidal cells. Feedback 
      regulation of cholinergic modulation allowed the network to respond to novel patterns with 
      strong cholinergic modulation, allowing accurate learning, and to respond to familiar patterns 
      with a decrease in cholinergic modulation, allowing recall. This function required that 
      suppression of synaptic transmission in region CA3 and CA1 be stronger for synapses in stratum 
      radiatum (arising from region CA3), in contrast to synapses in stratum lacunosum-moleculare 
      (arising from the entorhinal cortex). Experiments in brain slice preparations of the hippocampus 
      demonstrate this laminar selectivity.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> THE EFFECT OF NEURONAL GROWTH ON SYNAPTIC INTEGRATION</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> The way in which the dimensions of neurons change during postembryonic 
      development has important effects on their electrotonic structures. Theoretically, only one mode 
      of growth can conserve the electrotonic structures of growing neurons without employing changes 
      in membrane electrical properffes. If the dendritic diameters of a neuron increase as the square 
      of the increase in dendritic lengths, then the neuron's electrotonic structure is conserved. We 
      call this &quot; isoelectrotonic growth. &quot; In this study we compared the developmental 
      changes in morphology of two identiaed invertebrate neurons with theoreticsl growth curves. We 
      found that a cricket neuron, MGI, grows isoelectrotonically and thereby preserves its 
      electrotonic properties. The crayfish neuron, LG, grows in a nearly isometric manner that 
      results in an increase in its electrotonic length.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF RETINAL PHOTORECEPTORS.</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Retinal photoreceptors transmit light stimuli via electrical signals 
      generated by a change in a current, referred to here as the photocurrent. This voltage-sensitive 
      photocurrent is gated by cGMP, and carries sodium and calcium ln a 3:1 ratio. cGMP levels are 
      controlled by the opposing actions of guanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase, which are in turn 
      controlled by buffered calcium levels and photon absorption, respectively. We have used 
      Mathematica on a SUN workstation to generate a system of nine coupled ordinary differential 
      equations which reproduce changes in photocurrent in response to a light stimulus. In addition 
      to the processes noted above, the actions of the Na+/K+ exchanger and the voltage- and 
      concentration-dependent Na+/Ca++-K+ exchanger present in the photoreceptor inner and outer 
      segments are considered. Previously published models in the literature have not incorporated all 
      of these processes in a biologically relevant manner. The model is able to reproduce many 
      figures available in the literature, such as photocurrents measured in response to or steady 
      step changes in illumination and steady state levels of internal messengers. Supported by grant

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> SHORT-TERM MEMORY AS A SINGLE CELL PHENOMENON.</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> We present a model of short-term memory based on slowly-varying intrinsic 
      properties of single neurons. Cholinergic modulation of hippocampal and cortical neurons can 
      induce after-depolarization following spiking. When included in a model neuron, this effect 
      leads to memory storage and a sample-and-hold function. In a network model, memories can be 
      retained during periods of oscillation and rapidly reset through recurrent ihnibition.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> HOW ACTIVE DENDRITIC CONDUCTANCES AND SYNAPTIC INPUT CONTROL SOMATIC SPIKING IN 
  	  THE PURKINJE CELL: A MODELING STUDY</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> The level of depolarization at the soma of a Purkinje cell is strongly 
      dependent on the inward and outward currents distributed over the large area of its dendritic 
      tree. Here we analyze the relative contribution of synaptic and voltage-gated currents on the 
      spiking behavior of the soma, using a previously constructed realistic Purkinje cell model. We 
      find that dendritic Ca++ currents tend to depolarize the cell enough such that a net outward 
      synaptic current is necessary to produce slow somatic spiking rates. Fast somatic firing is 
      obtained with a net inward synaptic current, however, inhibition still needs to be present to 
      prevent bursting behavior. Spiking variability is determined by the temporal structure of both 
      inhibitory and excitatory input.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> KINETIC MODELS OF TRANSIENTION CHANNEL CURRENTS IN RESPONSE TO BRIEF PULSES OF 
      AGONIST</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Patch clamp measurements of the response of cyclic-nucleotide-gated 
      olfactory channels to brief (10-100 ms) pulses of cAMP provide new insights into the kinetics of 
      sensory transduction.l The measured time-course of both the current onset and decay in response 
      to a step-pulse oi agonist imposes new challenges for kinetic models. ln particular, our 
      detailed analysis of the slow time-dependence of the transient olfactory channel currents 
      induced by pulses of cAMP over a wide range of concentrations ( from 10-2 M&Ntilde; 10-6 M) 
      suggests a novel, Monod-Wyman-Changeux type2, kinetic model in which the unbound closed state of 
      the channel protein undergoes first a slow, k+l = 4 x 105M-1 s-1, binding step, then a slow 
      conformational step, B=20s-1, to an open state, followed by a series of more rapid binding steps 
      in the open state. A simplified numerical model of this kinetic scheme provides a good 
      description of the onset, decay and saturated values of the olfactory channel currents and 
      provides the basis for more detailed models of the full G-protein cascade describing olfactory 
      transduction, from the receptor activation by odor molecules to channel opening. 3 A similar 
      analysis is also applicable to recent measurements of the activation of slow NMDA currents by 
      brief pulses of glutamate. 4 These empirically derived kinetic models serve in turn to motivate 
      new experimental measurements to further elucidate the the non-equilibrium dynamics of 
      ligand-gated ion channels.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> CORRELATED GAMMA, BETA, AND THETA OSCILLATIONS IN OLFACTORY AND LIMBIC BRAIN 
  	  STRUCTURES DURING ODOR RECOGNITION</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Local field potential recordings from olfactory bulb (OB), prepyriform 
      cortex (PPC), entorhinal cortex (EC), and Dentate Gyrus (DG) of awake, behaving rats show that 
      gamma bursts are passed from OB through PPC, EC, and DG. Lower frequency gamma activity is also 
      passed back from EC to OB as a possible handshaking signal. Beta activity, arising in the EC and 
      passed to the PPC and OB and to the DG, precedes bursts occuring during odor recognition and may 
      be a reafferent signal used to tune the OB to receive an expected stimulus. Theta activity is 
      also correlated among these structures associated with a recognition task and during the 
      interburst period.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> A MODEL OF BIOCHEMICAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN GLUTAMATERGIC AND DOPAMINERGIC 
  	  SIGNALS IN STRIATAL NEURONS</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> An equilibrium model of glutamatergic and dopaminergic biochemical pathways 
      in striatal neurons shows that low intracellular free calcium concentrations (below 1 u M) act 
      synergistically with dopaminergic stimulation of adenylate cyclase. Concentrations exceeding 1u 
      M lead to inhibition of adenylate cyclase, which is not overcome by dopaminergic stimulation. 
      Further enzymatic pathways can be characterized as either calcium-dependent (PP2B), or as 
      sensitive to calcium and dopamine (PKA, PPl). The regulation of phosphoproteins (DARPP, MAP2) 
      demonstrates the complexity of crosstalk between transmitter-sensitive pathways. Such mechanisms 
      may play a role in synaptic plasticity, corhcostriatal interplay, and reinforcement learning.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> IMPROVING THE REALISM OF ATTRACTOR MODELS BY USING CORTICAL COLUMNS AS 
  	  FUNCTIONAL UNITS</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Attractor network models of cortical associative memory functions have 
      developed considerably over the past few years. Here we show that we can improve them further by 
      using cortical minicolumns instead of single neurons as functional units. The connectivity of 
      the model then becomes more realistic, since the dense and symmetric connectivity now may be 
      sparse and strongly asymmetric at the cell-to-cell level, thus resembling more the real cortex. 
      Simulations show that such a network, with model neurons of the Hodgkin-Huxley type, can operate 
      as an associative memory in much the same way as previous, simpler network models.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> A NONLINEAR HEBBIAN NETWORK THAT LEARNS TO DETECT DISPARITY IN RANDOM-DOT 
  	  STEREOGRAMS</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> We explore the use of a Hebb rule in a network of nonlinear neurons in order 
      to evaluate their ability to extract higher-order statistics from an input stream. As a test of 
      our methodology, we apply it to the problem of learning disparity in random-dot stereograms. Our 
      model network consists of two layers, with nonlinearities in the first-layer units only. These 
      non-linearities, inspired by those seen in neurobiology, allow the first layer to learn to 
      transform the input layer's pixel-based representation into a representation based upon coupled 
      pairs of left-right inputs. The second layer of the network then learns the disparities present 
      by extracting patterns within this new representation via a standard competitive learning rule. 
      The model demonstrates that a simple local learning rule can extract higher-order regularities 
      which cannot be extracted by a purely linear model.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> INFORMATION MAINTENANCE BY RETINAL GANGLION CELL SPIKES</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> A neuron may communicate its time-varying analog states with an interspike 
      interval (ISI) code. Using a biophysical model of a retinal ganglion cell spike generator, we 
      studied the performance of such a code. Our main result - a relatively small difference between 
      an injected stimulus current and an estimated signal reconstructed from the resulting spike 
      train - indicates tl1at the spike generator maintains information in individual ISIs. We 
      conceptualize spikes as instantaneous &quot;samples&quot; of the ncuron's analog state. 
      Specifically, ISIs are translated into samples of the analog somatic current by a monotonic 
      function, f (ISI).</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> USING MODELS TO DETERMINE THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF INTRINSIC MEMBRANE 
      PROPERTIES VERSUS SYNAPTIC ORGANIZATION IN OCTOPUS CELLS</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Compartmental models are used to determine the relative importance of 
      intrinsic membrane properties versus synaptic organization in producing the octopus cell's onset 
      response Three cells are modeled: a cell with a generic membrane and optimal synaptic structure, 
      a cell with an octopus-like membrane and randomly placed synapses, and a cell with an 
      octopus-like membrane and optimal synaptic structure The models' responses to tones are compared 
      to experimental data in terms of the latency and height of the onset peak of the post-stimulus 
      time histograms The results demonstrate that both properties play a role in determining the 
      cell's response to tones Using Models to Determine the Relative Importance of Intrinsic Membrane 
      Properties versus Synaptic Organization in Octopus Cells.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> UNDERSTANDING OCULAR DOMINANCE DEVELOPMENT FROM BINOCULAR INPUT STATISTICS</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> We recently hypothesized that striate cells are concerned with, among other 
      things, reducing binocular redundancy due to binocular correlations. In a multiscale 
      representation, this leads to a distribution of monocular/binocular cells and disparity 
      selective cells resembling what is observed in experiments. This theory is applied here to 
      explain the different ocular dominance column formations resulting from different (normal or 
      abnormal) developmental conditions such as strabismus and monocular deprivation. It is shown 
      that abnormal ocular dominance column formations, such as unequal column sizes for the two eyes 
      or increased monocularity, are consequences of decorrelation strategies applied to the altered 
      binocular input statistics under abnormal developmental conditions.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> SIMULATION OF THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS REGULATING TRANSMITTER RELEASE</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Simulations of presynaptic calcium dynamics and calcium interaction with 
      molecules that play a critical role in transmitter release (e.g., synaptotagmin), in response to 
      repetitive depolarization, led to the following conclusions: 1) the increase of single-liganded 
      synaptotagmin after the first stimulation is critical for the facilitation of release seen with 
      repeated stimulations, 2) a model with 2 calcium-sites for synaptotagmin generates results that 
      best match experimental data, 3) facilitation of release persists even when calcium influx is 
      progressively reduced, and 4) near equilibrated single-liganded synaptotagmins is responsible 
      for the decrease in the facilitatory effect with higher extracellular calcium concentrations.</p>

      <p><b>Abstract:</b> We present a novel approach to extracting information related to the 
      absolute speed of a looming stimulus. The method is based on two properties of looming detectors. 
      They respond sooner to a large approaching object with lower firing rate. The curves obtained by 
      integrating the activity of looming detectors in response to simuli of various sizes looming at 
      the same speed intersect within a small range. After thresholding, the onset time of these 
      integrator neurons form clusters, each corresponds to a looming speed. This mechanism offers a 
      flexible way for timing interaction with looming objects by neural modulation.</p>

      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Using a model of the olfactory cortex we demonstrate how noise and chaos can 
      play a role in the complex dynamics involved in learning and memory. We show that noise can 
      speed up neural information processing and reduce recall time in associative memory tasks. Noise 
      can also induce transitions between different memory states. Oscillations and (transient) chaos, 
      induced by noise or by an increase in neuronal excitability, is shown to improve system 
      performance. We discuss how these effects can be under neuromodulatory control.</p>

      MEMORY</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Based on precise data collected from experiments conducted at different 
      organizational levels (anatomy, electrophysiology and behavior), we propose an investigation of 
      the possible mechanisms of sensory memory in the bee's olfactory system. In this goal, we have 
      investigated the modulation and control between the two levels of olfactory information 
      processing, the antennal lobe glomeruli and the mushroom bodies. We use simplified neurons, but 
      realistic architecture. As a first conclusion, we postulate that sensory memory may be achieved 
      by modulation of the inhibitory synaptic activity of antennal lobe neurons. These first results

      <p><b>Abstract:</b> We tested the hypothesis that learned movement trajectories of different 
      shapes can be stored in, and generated by, largely overlapping neural networks. We trained a 
      massively interconnected neural network to generate different shapes of internally stored, 
      dynamically evolving movement trajectories using a general-purpose, core part, common to all 
      networks, and a special-purpose part, specific for a particular trajectory. The percentage of 
      trajectory-specific units needed to generate a certain trajectory was small (2- 5%). The core 
      network alone could generate externally instructed trajectories but not internally stored ones, 
      for which both the core and the trajectory-specific part were needed. These results suggest an 
      efficient and effective mechanism for storing learned motor patterns.(Supported by the Office of

      <p><b>Abstract:</b> The oculomotor system maintains binocular eye alignment throughout life 
      through an adaptive recalibration process. Empirical evidence has indicated there is a 
      spatiotopic representation in the central nervous system to provide accurate binocular movements 
      in situations where immediate error feedback is unavailable. We have investigated the mechanisms 
      for this spatiotopic representation by modifying the default binocular alignment in one position 
      of gaze, and measuring the associated eye responses in other positions. To explain the results, 
      we have developed a computational model that cross-couples the activities of two classes of eye 
      position sensitive neurons. </p>

      to the generation of cellular ionic signals. The objects are: chemicals and buffers (both

      dependencies), a broad range of stimuli and graphing windows. Each object has an extensive set 
      of properties. The system of ordinary llifferential equations to describe membrane level events 
      and partial differential equations for events mediated by buffered diffusion are solved using 
      optimtied numerical methods (Le. Gear method for ODEs and the Crank-Nicholson method for PDE's).

      <p><b>Abstract:</b> A user interface in part determines the effectiveness of simulation software. 
      The Hypertext Compartmental Neuronal Simulator is a software application for mathematical 
      modeling single neurons or networks containing a small number of compartments (&lt;30). The user 
      interface consists of windows containing text mixed with interactive graphics with both 
      point-and-click and command line input. The user interface and simulation protocols may be 
      modified or extended dynamically at run-time using the application's embedded Tool Command 
      Language (TCL) interpreter. Numerical efficiency is enhanced by use of a variable step-size, 
      variable order integration method and compilation of model equations in C or Fortran. Use of 
      de-facto standard software toolkits such as X windows and Tcl/Tk reduce the size and complexity 
      of the application software itself to under 2000 lines of code. Source code for demonstration 
      software solving the Hodgkin-Huxley equations is available on request. Requires Unix, X windows

      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Neural processing of the millesecond time range is analyzed with the Stroop

      They receive projections from the Wernick(word-processing) area and colorprocessing pathways. 
      Model analysis shows (1) lateral inhibition between the columns restricts columns' firing to the 
      most activated ones by surpressing the others before firing, which enables the cortical 
      processing of a few hundred milliseconds, but (2) the inhibition delays the processing if the 
      two projections deliver the inconguent stimuli.</p>

      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Most research on the neural control of multilegged locomotion has focused on 
      the problem of pattern generation, namely on how to produce appropriately phased patterns of 
      bursting activity in leg motor neurons so as to generate stable walking gaits. Fixed pattern 
      generation alone, however, is not sufficient to achieve agile locomotion over irregular terrain. 
      Agile locomotion requires the incorporation of sensory feedback signals which convey information 
      about leg-substrate interactions. We present a biologically-plausible model of a single-leg 
      controller for substratefinding and compliance control, discuss its relevance to insect 
      neurobiology, and evaluate its performance in controlling a multijoint robotic leg.</p>

  	  CHARACTERIZATION USING SIMULTANEOUS MULTI- SINGLE NEURON RECORDINGS</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> To characterize sensory information processing at the network level we have 
      developed techniques for chronic simultaneous recording of large numbers of single neurons 
      within multiple connected areas of the brain of awake, behaving animals. Here, 48 single neurons 
      were simultaneously recorded in the facial whisker representations of the trigeminal ganglion 
      (Vg), principal (PrV) and spinal (SpV) trigeminal nuclei, ventral posteromedial thalamus (VPM) 
      and primary somatosensory (Sl) cortex. Multivariate statistical analysis and 3D graphics 
      techniques were used to analyze responses to discrete whisker stimulation through these 
      different levels. Whereas at lower levels of this system whisker location was directly coded by 
      discrete short latency responses, at higher levels this code was successively more broadly 
      distributed over the neuronal population and over post-stimulus time. In addition, spontaneous 
      8-30 Hz oscillatory (mu-type) discharge was ubiquitous in these recordings in awake animals. 
      Occuring mainly during immobile motor expectancy, these were uncorrelated with whisker movements, 
      but interacted complexly with responses to whisker stimulation. To conclude, sensory processing 
      in this system involves spatiotemporally distributed coding and is also subject to dynamical 
      state transitions.</p>

      Cells are organized in a two-dimensional layer with an embedded orientation preference map and

      surround inhibition and long-range clustered connections, where the latter are only between

      generates irregular spike trains with broad inter-spike interval distribution as found in 
      cortical data (Softky and Koch, 1993). Neighboring cells show a large arnount of synchronization 
      while more distant cells show stimulus dependent synchronization similar to that observed 
      experimentally (Gray and Singer, 1989) the cross-correlation peaks are larger for cells 
      stimulated with the same orientation (vs. different orientation) even if they don't have the

      interactions between the tasks.</p></li>
