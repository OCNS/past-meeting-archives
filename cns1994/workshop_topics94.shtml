  	<h2>The Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting</h2>
  	
  	<h3>July 1994, Monterey, California</h3>
  	
  	<h4>CNS*1994 Workshops Topics</h4>
  	
  	<h4>Using HPC in CNS</h4>
  	
  	<p>Some areas of research which the researchers involved in CNS are not sufficiently leveraging, 
  	probably due to lack of familiarity, are parallel computing, optimization and automatic 
  	differentiation (AD), areas which fall under High Performance Computing (HPC). The purpose of 
  	this workshop will be for the participants to familiarize each other with modeling efforts -- be 
  	they from within their own areas of research or others -- which utilize HPC techniques and 
  	technologies. Discussions could be general, for example, how come over the years at CNS 
  	conferences, the computational work presented hasn't utilized optimization techniques, despite 
  	the fact that a lot of what we do is model to data correlation? We could also talk specific, e.g. 
  	where, how reliable, and how efficient are the HPC software packages which we could utilize today 
  	to enhace our models? If you have any questions or suggestions about this workshop, send mail 
  	to Peyvand Khademi at Argonne National Lab.</p>
