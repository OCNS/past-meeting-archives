  	<h2>The Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting</h2>
  	
  	<h3>July 1994, Monterey, California</h3>
  	
  	<h4>CNS*1994 Travel arrangements</h4>
  	
  	<p>The CNS 94 Meeting site is the Doubletree Hotel at Fisherman's Wharf in Monterey. This is THE 
  	PREMIER resort/conference hotel in Monterey. The hotel is built around a walking mall and plaza 
  	surrounded by several historic buildings (including the old customs house) and a beautiful 
  	regional museum. This plaza is situated at the dead-end of old Alvarado street where it runs into 
  	Monterey Bay (right at the entrance to Fisherman's Wharf, where there are many fine, inexpensive 
  	seafood restaurants.) Local attractions include windsurfing, kayaking, and snorkeling. For those 
  	wishing to stay dry, a beautiful bayside (paved) path extends for several miles in both directions 
  	up and down the coast from the hotel, perfect for walking, biking, skating or running. Skates and 
  	bikes are available for rental at reasonable rates. The famous &quot;Cannery Row&quot; section of 
  	town, including the spectacular Aquarium, is 5-minutes away by rollerblade along this path. Other 
  	local attractions requiring a short car trip include visits to Carmel, the Carmel Mission, the 
  	Seventeen Mile Drive, and several very beautiful beach parks. The area is also known for its 19 
  	champion golf courses. Charter fishing is available from the doorstep of the hotel. The hotel has 
  	a swimming pool, Jacuzzi and &quot;spa room&quot; available for all guests.</p>
  	
  	<p>The Hotel management has been extremely generous in giving us highly discounted rates for their 
  	rooms during their peak tourist season. Details are as follows: Nightly rate for non-student 
  	conference attendees (and spouses): $119 PER ROOM. THESE ARE DOUBLE OCCUPANCY ROOMS: THAT IS, TWO 
  	PEOPLE SHARING A ROOM WOULD SPLIT THIS $119 charge.</p>
  	
  	<p>Nightly rates for students: $99. This is also the ROOM rate, not the per-person rate. These are 
  	double occupancy rooms.</p>
  	
  	<p>There is a block of 10 rooms guaranteed at the Government per diem rate of $77/night single, 
  	$97 double occupancy. PLEASE DO NOT TRY TO GET THESE UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY GOVERNMENT... LIKE NIH 
  	OR NSF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
  	
  	<p>In all cases, extra &quot;cots&quot; can be put in the rooms, if you want to save even more 
  	money... There is a $20 charge for each extra person above 2. CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 18 ARE 
  	FREE!</p>
  	
  	<p>You must make your reservations directly with the hotel, and guarantee them with a credit card. 
  	YOU MUST IDENTIFY YOUR AFFILIATION WITH THE MEETING TO GET THE SPECIAL RATES!!!!!</p>
  	
  	<p>Qetails are as follows: Doubletree Hotel at Fisherman's Wharf 2 Portola Plaza Monterey, Ca 
  	93940 (408) 649-4511 Located at the end of Alvarado Street. Parking available through the hotel.</p>
  	
  	<p> There is an airport at Monterey, and the hotel is a short cab ride from the airport. Monterey 
  	is 1 1/2 hour drive from the San Jose airport, and a bit over 2 hours from the San Francisco 
  	airport.</p>
