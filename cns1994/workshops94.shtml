  	<h2>The Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting</h2>
  	
  	<h3>July 1994, Monterey, California</h3>
  	
  	<h4>CNS*1994 Workshops</h4>
  	
  	<p>The Post-meeting workshops will be held over two full days at Asilomar Conference Center at 
  	Asilomar State Beach in Pacific Grove, California. The workshops are intended to provide an 
  	opportunity for conference participants to informally discuss results presented at the main 
  	meeting as well as important issues in computational neuroscience. The organizer of the workshops 
  	this year is Mike Hasselmo.</p>
  	
  	<h4>Workshop Topics</h4>
  	
  	<p>Workshop topics will be established in one of two ways:</p>
  	
  	<ol>
  	  <li>Meeting participants interested in particular subjects can submit those subjects prior to 
  	  the meeting to Mike Hasselmo, via email. Suggestions should include the title of the workshop, 
  	  a brief abstract describing the issue(s) involved, and any other meeting attendees known to be 
  	  interested in participating. Information about these workshops will be posted on the CNS*94 ftp 
  	  site.</li>
  	  <li>Workshop subjects can also be suggested during the main meeting. We are particularly 
  	  interested in topics that arise as a result of meeting presentations. A bulletin board at the 
  	  meeting will be used for participant sign-up. The bulletin board will list all suggested 
  	  workshops as well as the current list of participants.</li>
  	</ol>
  	
  	<h4>Workshop Structure</h4>
  	
  	<p>The workshops themselves will be conducted as informal discussions. Large paper tablets will 
  	be available. The use of slides or overheads, however, is discouraged. Each workshop group will 
  	be asked to appoint a secretary to keep track of the relevant questions and discussion points. 
  	Particular attention should be paid to the relevant &quot;open&quot; questions on the particular 
  	issue being discussed. Evening sessions will be organized in which each workshop will report 
  	their results to the entire group.</p>
  	
  	<h4>Workshop Location</h4>
  	
  	<p>All workshops and lodging for participants will be at the Asilomar Conference Center. This 
  	state run conference facility is located on the beautiful Asilomar State Beach in Pacific Grove 
  	California. The facilities include multiple cabins and lodges as well as many opportunities for 
  	walks and nature study.</p>
  	
  	<h4>Logistical Arrangements</h4>
  	
  	<p>All workshop participants will be housed at the conference center. Meals and lodging are 
  	included in the workshop registration costs. Transportation will be arranged to and from the main 
  	meeting location in downtown Monterey. The weather can be expected to be warm and sunny.</p>
  	
  	<h4>Suggestions for Workshop Topics</h4>
  	
  	<p>Please send suggestions to Mike Hasselmo.</p>
  	
  	<p>Include the following material:</p>
  	
  	<ol>
  	  <li>a title</li>
  	  <li>a brief (300 word) abstract</li>
  	  <li>a list of any known interested participants</li>
  	</ol>
