  	<h2>The Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting</h2>
  	
  	<h3>July 6 - 10, 1997, Big Sky, Montana</h3>
  	
  	<h4>CNS*1997 Call for Papers</h4>
  	
  	<p>This is the sixth annual meeting of an interdisciplinary conference addressing a broad range 
  	of research approaches and issues involved in the field of computational neuroscience. These 
  	meetings bring together experimental and theoretical neurobiologists along with engineers, 
  	computer scientists, cognitive scientists, physicists, and mathematicians interested in the 
  	functioning of biological nervous systems. Peer reviewed papers are presented all related to 
  	understanding how nervous systems compute. As in previous years, CNS*97 will equally emphasize 
  	experimental, model-based, and more abstract theoretical approaches to understanding 
  	neurobiological computation.</p>
  	
  	<p>The meeting in 1997 will take place at the Huntley Lodge in Big Sky, Montana, and include 
  	plenary, contributed, and poster sessions. The first session starts at 9 am, Sunday, July 6th and 
  	the last ends at 5 pm on Thursday, July 10th. There will be no parallel sessions. The mechanism 
  	for publishing a proceedings volume is currently under review. The meeting will include time for 
  	informal workshops focused on current issues in computational neuroscience. Travel funds will be 
  	available for students and postdoctoral fellows presenting papers at the meeting. Child day care 
  	will also be available.</p>
  	
  	<p>Big Sky Resort (<a href="http://www.bigskyresort.com">http://www.bigskyresort.com</a>) is 
  	approximately 1/2 hour by car from the Bozeman airport (BZN). Several major carriers, including 
  	Delta, NorthWest, United and Horizon, fly into Bozeman, offering over 100 flights per week. The 
  	meeting is currently negotiating for very reasonable rates. Airport shuttles from the airport to 
  	Big Sky will also be organized by the meeting. The housing costs at Big Sky will be considerably 
  	less than those at the previous meeting sites, and the management has kindly offered to extend 
  	the discounted rates to attendees to include the week preceding and the week following the 
  	meeting, for those who wish to come early and/or stay late. The surrounding area offers 
  	spectacular recreational opportunities. (Check your maps!)</p>
  	
  	<p> With this announcement we solicit the submission of presented papers. All papers will be 
  	refereed. Authors should send original research contributions in the form of a 1000-word (or 
  	less) summary and a separate single page 100 word abstract clearly stating their results. 
  	Summaries are for program committee use only. Abstracts will be published in the conference 
  	program. At the bottom of each abstract page and on the first summary page, indicate preference 
  	for oral or poster presentation and specify at least one appropriate category and theme from the 
  	following list:</p>
