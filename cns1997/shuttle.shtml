  	<h1>CNS*1997</h1>
  	
  	<h2>The Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting</h2>
  	
  	<h3>July 6 - 10, 1997, Big Sky, Montana</h3>
  	
  	<h4>CNS*1997 Shuttle Service</h4>
  	
  	<p>Big Sky resort is about 1 hour's drive from the airport. For those of you who will not be 
  	renting a car, we have arranged for bus transportation between the airport and meeting site.</p>
  	
  	<p>The cost per person, round trip, will be <b>$15</b> ($5 for each child under 16 years old). 
  	The fee will be paid to CNS, not to the bus company, so you don't need to pay at the terminal. 
  	Please send your checks and credit card information to Judy Macias, using the questionnaire 
  	below.</p>
  	
  	<h4>When you get to the Bozeman airport</h4>
  	
  	<ol>
  	  <li>Look for a CNS*97 sign at the big bear sculpture near the baggage claim area. Don't worry, 
  	  you'll see it; the bear is very big, and the terminal is very small. As soon as it is obvious 
  	  that all arrivees from the most recent flight are assembled, a bus from the Karst Stage Company 
  	  will take you to Big Sky.</li>
  	  <li>If you are a straggler and no busses seem to be out front, and no people from Karst are by 
  	  the big bear, go to the 4x4 ground transportation booth near the car rental area next to the 
  	  baggage claim area. We have arranged for individuals or small groups to be shuttled up to Big 
  	  Sky in smaller vans when there aren't enough passengers on a flight to warrant a big bus. This 
  	  procedure will also cover the people who miss flights or connections, and end up coming in at a 
  	  time that is different than expected.</li>
  	  <li>If all else fails, call the Karst Stage Company at 586-8567, extension 1-2060, and ask for 
  	  Gary.</li>
  	  <li>Some people may want to visit Bozeman before leaving. The way to do this is to go ahead and 
  	  take the bus back to the airport, and take a cab to Bozeman (about $7) If you have reservations 
  	  in a Bozeman Hotel, most of them operate courtesy vans that will come and get you from the 
  	  airport when you call.</li>
  	</ol>
