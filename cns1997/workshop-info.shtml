  	<h1>CNS*1997</h1>
  	
  	<h2>The Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting</h2>
  	
  	<h3>July 6 - 10, 1997, Big Sky, Montana</h3>
  	
  	<h4>CNS*1997 Workshop information</h4>
  	
  	<p><b>Workshop Structure</b></p>
  	
  	<p>This year, the workshops session will consist of two types of events:</p>
  	
  	<p><b>* Informal workshop sessions</b></p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">These are informal, interactive discussions among small groups of 
  	participants with related interests. There are no scheduled talks, and slides and overheads are 
  	not allowed. Huge paper tablets are provided in lieu of whiteboards. The organizer's role is to 
  	define the topic and then moderate the discussion to keep it productive and on the topic.</p>
  	
  	<p><b>* Minisymposia</b></p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">These are more formal sessions about a specific area of interest. The 
  	organizers will present a short overview of the questions of interest, and will schedule a 
  	limited number of short presentations around these questions. Interactive discussions among 
  	participants and presenters, as well as spontaneous presentations are encouraged. The 
  	organizer's role is to define the topic , suggest a number of presenters and then moderate the 
  	discussion to keep it productive and on the topic.</p>
  	
  	<p>The workshops are afternoon-long sessions interspersed with talk and poster sessions during the 
  	meeting. Meeting attendees can attend any workshop they want (they don't have to specifically 
  	register) so preliminary sign-ups are only used to determine interest and assign rooms.</p>
  	
  	<p>There is no separate registration fee for the workshops.</p>
  	
  	<hr />
  	
  	<h4>How to propose Workshop Topics</h4>
  	
  	<p><b>* Informal workshop sessions</b></p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">1) Meeting participants interested in particular subjects are encouraged 
  	to send topics prior to the meeting to Christiane Linster, via email. Workshop proposals consist 
  	of short blurbs describing the discussion topic; these are encouraged to be phrased as lists of 
  	questions to be discussed. Information about these workshops will be posted on the CNS*97 web 
  	site and at the conference.</p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">2) Workshop topics can also be suggested during the main meeting. We are 
  	particularly interested in topics that arise as a result of meeting presentations. A bulletin 
  	board at the meeting will be used for participant sign-up. The bulletin board will list all 
  	suggested workshops as well as the current list of participants.</p>
  	
  	<p><b>* Minisymposia</b></p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">Meeting participants interested in organizing a more formal session should 
  	send topics and a putative list of speakers to Christiane Linster prior to the meeting, via 
  	email. Information about these session will be posted on the CNS*97 website and at the 
  	conference.</p>
  	
  	<hr />
  	
  	<h4>Responsibilities of Workshop Organizers/Moderators</h4>
  	
  	<p>Organizing a workshop session at the CNS meeting involves:</p>
  	
  	<ul>
  	  <li>writing a topic description for the proposed workshop</li>
  	  <li>moderating the discussion during the workshop, and /or organizing presentations</li>
  	  <li>after the meeting, writing an informal summary of the discussion and sending it back to the 
  	  workshops coordinator for inclusion on the CNS web site.</li>
  	</ul>
  	
  	<p>And that's it!</p>
  	
  	<p>To suggest workshop topics, send e-mail to Christiane Linster.</p>
