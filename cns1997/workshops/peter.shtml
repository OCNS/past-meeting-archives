  	<h4>The role of chaotic dynamics in neural systems.</h4>
  	
  	<p><b>Peter Rowat</b></p>
  	
  	<p>It is proposed to hold a discussion on the following topic:</p>
  	
  	<p>Is the occurrence of low-dimensional deterministic chaos in a neural system simply an 
  	epiphenomenon like the rattling sounds in a car when driving on a rough road, or is it an 
  	essential functional component of the system, like the action of your car springs on the rough 
  	road?</p>
  	
  	<p>Some questions that could be raised:</p>
  	
  	<p>Recent work in a small motor-pattern-generating system has shown that an isolated neuron may 
  	display low-dimensional chaotic dynamics, and that intercellular connections in small networks 
  	may modify - increase or decrease - the Lyapunov exponents associated with neurons having chaotic 
  	dynamics. What functional advantages does this confer on a motor system?</p>
  	
  	<p>Is the unexpectedly high variability of the interspike interval in cortical spiketrains due to 
  	deterministic chaos rather than stochastic noise - high-dimensional chaos - in the environment? 
  	Van Vreeswick and Sompolinsky have proposed that this is due to an approximate balance between 
  	the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to a neuron in a large cortical-like network.</p>
  	
  	<p>A closely related question arises from the observations by Mainen and Sejnowski of precisely 
  	timed spike firing patterns in response to stimuli with small, synaptic-input like, fluctuations. 
  	Could this result from the small fluctuations &quot;controlling&quot; the endogenously chaotic 
  	dynamics of individual cells?</p>
  	
  	<p>Is the chaos observed in olfactory systems (Freeman et al) generated endogenously by the 
  	chaotic dynamics of individual neurons, or is it a consequence of the connections between 
  	neurons, or by some combination of intrinsic cellular and network dynamics?</p>
  	
  	<p>A physical system in a chaotic parameter regime can switch between distinct strange attractors 
  	in response to a changing input much faster than a corresponding non-chaotic system. Is this 
  	property utilized in biological sensory-motor systems?</p>
