  	<h2>The Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting</h2>
  	
  	<h3>July 6 - 10, 1997, Big Sky, Montana</h3>
  	
  	<h4>CNS*1997 Travel, food and lodging</h4>
  	
  	<p>The conference will take place at Big Sky Resort 
  	(<a href="http://www.bigskyresort.com">http://www.bigskyresort.com</a>), approximately 1/2 hour 
  	by car from the Bozeman airport (BZN). Several major carriers, including 
  	<a href="http://www.delta-air.com">Delta</a>, <a href="http://www.united.com/">Northwest</a>, 
  	<a href="http://www.ual.com">United</a> and Horizon, fly into Bozeman, offering over 100 flights 
  	per week. Airport shuttles from the airport to Big Sky will be organized by the meeting. The 
  	housing costs at Big Sky will be considerably less than those at the previous meeting sites, and 
  	the management has kindly offered to extend the discounted rates to attendees to include the week 
  	preceding and the week following the meeting, for those who wish to come early and/or stay late. 
  	The surrounding area offers spectacular recreational opportunities. (Check your maps!)</p>
  	
  	<p>For your convenience, here are a few links to on-line airline ticketing services (although 
  	they have no association with the conference):</p>
