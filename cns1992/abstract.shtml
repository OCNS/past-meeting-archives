  	  <p><b>Title:</b> A Model of Human Visual Attention</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Visual attention is the ability to dynamically restrict processing to a 
  	  subset of the visual field. Such a mechanism is necessary to efficiently perform many 
  	  intermediate level visual tasks. This presentation describes VISIT a novel neural network model 
  	  of covert visual attention. The current system models the search for target objects in scenes 
  	  containing multiple distractors. This is a natural task for people, it is studied extensively by 
  	  psychologists, and it requires attention. The network's behavior closely matches the known 
  	  psychophysical data on visual search and visual attention. VISIT also matches much of the 
  	  physiological data on attention and provides a novel view of the functionality of a number of 
  	  visual areas.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Overview of the Valentino Computational Neuroscience Workbench for Simulation 
  	  of Neural Systems</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> We present an innovative simulator system designed to facilitate research in 
  	  computational neuroscience. The Valentino Computational Neuroscience Workbench (CNW) 
  	  incorporates an object-oriented design and a neuroscience workbench metaphor wherein a number of 
  	  independent tools manipulate a shared persistent simulation structure. Central to the system is 
  	  a novel tool for configuring structured neural networks using a graphical user-interface and 
  	  powerful interconnection selection criteria and schema. Together these make the Valentino CNW 
  	  powerful, flexible, extendible and, yet, still easy-to-use - unlike some other presently 
  	  available simulators.</p>

      models of the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex provide experimentally testable predictions</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Previous, static backpropagation 
      models of the vestibulo-<br />
      oculomotor system were able to capture the distributed aspects of <br />
      eye-movement command representation by brainstem neurons.<br />
      However, these models do not readily offer testable predictions.<br />
      More recently, recurrent backpropagation models have been used to <br />
      study the dynamic and nonlinear features of the vestibulo-ocular<br />
      reflex (VOR). The dynamic models make clear predictions concern-<br />
      ing the behavior of VOR neurons following lesions. Some of the<br />
      predictions from the recurrent backpropagation models differ in<br />
      critical ways from those derived from analytical models of VOR.<br />
      The testability of the recurrent models encourages a continued<br />
      dialog between theory and experiment.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Neural Routing Circuits in Primate Visual Cortex</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Directed visual attention can be modeled by neural routing circuits that 
  	  provide high-level areas of the visual cortex with dynamic access to retinal sensory inputs. 
  	  This approach has many computational advantages over the more static, feedforward models of 
  	  vision which construct increasingly more complex receptive fields as one moves upward through 
  	  the hierarchy of cortical areas. Here, we provide details on the structure of neural routing 
  	  circuits and their control as illustrated by interactive computer programs. Neural substrates 
  	  for routing and control are proposed and physiological support for the model is discussed.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Dopaminergic Induced Multi-stable States in Neural Networks </p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> The dynamical behaviour of neural networks is typically considered to be 
  	  controlled by the synaptic weights and by the neurons' thresholds. Recently, it was suggested 
  	  that the network's activity can be modified by solely modulating the neuronal activation 
  	  function. We examine the effect of modulatory neurotransmitter on the behavior of a simple 
  	  excitatory neural network model by varying the neuronal gain. The network passes through several 
  	  qualitatively distinct regions of activity, traversing from a uni-steady state to a multi-steady 
  	  state region, and back to a region of a small number of steady states. Our results may shed 
  	  light on the possible regulatory role of dopamine in the cortico-striato-pallido-thalamic loop, 
  	  and the effects of its malfunction in the pathogenesis of movement related disorders.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Numerical simulations of the electric organ discharge of weakly electric 
  	  fish.</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> A model of a weakly electric fish was constructed with data taken from 
  	  Apteronotus leptorhynchus, and the electric organ discharge was simulated using boundary 
  	  element and finite element methods. Maps of the electric potential measured around a live fish 
  	  were used to calibrate the model parameters and test the results. Initial results suggest the 
  	  fish's body position has a significant effect on the electrical images detected by the fish. Our 
  	  goal is to quantitatively simulate various sequences of electrosensory input being sent to the 
  	  central nervous system as the result of the fish's exploratory behavior.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> A study of computation in a simple Neuronal Network: experimental recording and 
  	  theoretical simulation of the immature rat cerebellar cortex</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Experimental and theoretical analysis of the 5-7 days old rat cerebellar 
  	  cortex (Cbcx) was undertaken to get some insight on the role of inhibition in modulating the 
  	  ongoing activity and the spatial distribution of functionally correlated neurons. Pairs of 
  	  Purkinje cells (PC) were recorded in vivo before and after uncoupling the inhibitory links 
  	  (mediated by their recurrent collaterals) via superfusion of biccuculin. Statistical techniques 
  	  were used to assess the characteristics and correlation of the spike trains. A new tool is 
  	  presented which computes an index of informational entropy. Experimental results are compared 
  	  with simulation results from a biologically accurate model of this structure. It appears that 
  	  inhibition: 1- significantly changes the spike trains data; 2- it restricts the space of states 
  	  in which the network can evolve and 3-it leads to a spatio-functional segregation of correlated 
  	  PCs. The limitations of CNS models will be discussed.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Power Spectrum Analysis of MT Neurons from the Awake Monkey</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> We analyzed extracellular spike trains recorded from single cells in area MT 
  	  in rhesus monkeys which performed a demanding motion discrimination task (Newsome, Britten &amp; 
  	  Movshon, 1989). In particular, we computed the power spectra of spike trains from 2 sec long 
  	  trials of visual stimulation during which the monkey held fixation. Most cells have a relatively 
  	  flat spectrum with a dip at low frequencies, indicative of a Poisson process with a refractory 
  	  period. 10% of cells have a substantial peak in the spectrum between 25-50~z, but the presence 
  	  and strength of this peak does not correlate in any way with the know behavior of the monkey 
  	  (e.g. correct or incorrect decision). However, there exists a very strong correlation between 
  	  cells that discharge 2-4 spikes within 37msec (burst cells) and cells that have a peak in the 
  	  power spectrum. The simplest interpretation of this data is that a small fraction of cells 
  	  randomly and independently of the stimulus fire in bursts followed by a refractory period, 
  	  giving rise to a peak near 40Hz in the power spectrum</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Multi-Layer Bidirectional Auto-Associative Memories</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> This paper describes an auto-associative memory system, which is based on a 
  	  combination of the Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM) architecture and the use of randomly 
  	  generated hidden representations called Randomized Internal Representations. The capacity and 
  	  recall performance of the proposed system have been investigated under reduced connectivity and 
  	  noise conditions. Analytical and simulation results suggested that the proposed system has an 
  	  overall improved performance over other auto-associator networks. A multi-layer version of the 
  	  basic system allows for storage and recall of non-random patterns. The system is capable of 
  	  detecting novelty in the input when augmented with a plasticity-stability control mechanism. 
  	  There is a number of functional and anatomical similarities between the proposed multi-layer 
  	  system and the hippocampal formation in the brain.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> An Adaptive Neural Model of Early Visual Processing</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> We describe an adaptive computer model of processing in the mammalian visual 
  	  system, from retina to primary visual cortex, which incorporates: processing in retina and LGN; 
  	  Non-negative neuron outputs and connection strengths; On-center and off-center channels; 
  	  Excitatory and inhibitory cortical populations (3750 neurons); Non-linear cortical neurons, 
  	  based on membrane potential and relaxation oscillator equations; Adaptive cortical connections. 
  	  With images of the real world as input, the model robustly and simultaneously develops: oriented 
  	  receptive field patterns, Gabor function-like fields, smoothly-varying orientation preference, 
  	  and retinotopic mapping. Experiments with this and related models suggest the same mechanism may 
  	  produce ocular dominance, and possibly color blobs</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Self-organising ion channel densities: the rationale for Anti-Hebb</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Although neural communication and integration are determined by the 
  	  distribution of ion channels in the membrane, the role of voltage-dependent channels in neural 
  	  integration is poorly understood. Here, an argument is presented for an `anti-Hebbian' rule 
  	  which changes the distribution of intrinsic conductances in order to flatten voltage curvatures 
  	  in dendrites. Simulations show that this rule can account for the self-organisation of dynamical 
  	  receptive field properties such as resonance and direction selectivity, and also for faithful 
  	  conduction of a signal in a cable. Various cellular mechanisms are proposed including 
  	  activity-dependent migration of channel proteins in the plane of the membrane.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Correlational-Based Development of Disparity Sensitivity</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> A correlational-based model of development of disparity sensitivity is 
  	  proposed. Two input layers are fully connected to a single cortical layer with fixed 
  	  intra-cortical connections, and the weights modified by an unsupervised linear Hebb rule. A 
  	  small amount of between-eye correlation (approximately 5% the amplitude of the same-eye 
  	  correlation) leads to the development of binocular cortical cells with the left and right 
  	  receptive fields aligned, i.e. zero disparity. Several cells which become monocularly dominated 
  	  tend to have non-zero disparity preferences. The same relationship between ocular dominance and 
  	  disparity has been experimentally observed in the visual cortex.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Modeling and Simulation of Cerebellar Networks Implicated in Classical 
  	  Conditioning of the Rabbit Eyeblink Response</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Continuing previous research, several new detailed compartment models of 
  	  cerebellar networks were developed based on new data from extra-cellular recordings in rabbit 
  	  during conditioning of the eyeblink response. New sites of synaptic plasticity were postulated, 
  	  as suggested by recent cooling-probe experiments, and these were incorporated into the models. 
  	  The models were tested by simulation using the CAJAL simulator, which produces action potential 
  	  spike trains that can be compared against the experimental time-trace data. Effects of 
  	  cooling-induced lesions are simulated by varying certain parameters in the model neurons 
  	  implicated by the lesion experiments. Conditioning is simulated by varying parameters in the 
  	  model synapses of neurons implicated by these same experiments in a series of computer runs 
  	  simulating training trials. Results provide further evidence that these cerebellar circuits may 
  	  be the main neural substrates of this conditioning paradigm.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Non-Linear Spatio-Temporal Filtering in Dendrites: Directional Selectivity and 
  	  Beyond</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> We consider the non-linear spatio-temporal computation of directional 
  	  selectivity (DS), and describe a model of retinal DS whose key elements are contained within the 
  	  dendritic branches of amacrine cells. Interaction between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic 
  	  input provides the non-linearity crucial for DS. Distal outputs, cable properties and synaptic 
  	  kinetics underly spatial asymmetry, discrimination, and temporal delay, respectively. The model 
  	  is supported by simulations of retinal cells and is consistent with recent electrophysiological 
  	  data. Similar conditions may occur elsewhere in the brain, and simulations of hippocampal 
  	  pyramidal cells suggest that dendritic filtering that is selective for synaptic activation 
  	  sequence may be a more general phenomenon.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> A Silicon-based multi-single neuron probe designed for use in the cerebellum</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> We have developed a silicon-based multichannel recording system for 
  	  monitoring the single-unit activity of multiple neurons in the cerebellum. The system consists 
  	  of a 15 channel multielectrode array, supporting electronics, and computers for data acquisition 
  	  and analysis. The probe is a comb-like structure with 5 teeth and 3 recording sites per tooth. 
  	  The geometry of the recording sites has been tailored to the anatomy of cerebellar cortex. Each 
  	  tooth is very sharp and enters the brain with little or no dimpling. Recording sites, connecting 
  	  leads, and wire-bonding pads are fabricated on a silicon substrate using thin-film technology. 
  	  These probes have been used to record spontaneous granule cell, simple spike and complex spike 
  	  responses in crus lla of the rat cerebellar hemisphere with excellent signal to noise 
  	  characteristics.</p>

  	  electrodes in macaques responding to one stimulus by lifting their hand from a lever within 500 
  	  msec (GO task), and to another by holding the lever (NO-GO task). FFTs of single-trial 
  	  potentials were computed in a sliding window. Broad-band power increased during the response in 
  	  the GO condition timelocked across cortical sites, and broad-band coherence between sites also 
  	  increased. In individual trials, high-frequency oscillations briefly synchronized at the 
  	  low-frequency amplitude peak.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Simulations of Synaptic Integration in Neocortical Pyramidal Cells</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Despite their electrotonic compactness, neocortical pyramidal cells cannot 
  	  be considered as point neurons because of nonlinear interactions between inputs on the same 
  	  dendritic branch. Using compartmental simulations, we have shown that dendritic saturation is 
  	  significant for physiological levels of synaptic activation. We have also confirmed earlier 
  	  results showing that inhibition strong enough to produce a significant reduction in the input 
  	  resistance of a cell does not prevent the firing of the cell if it is receiving strong 
  	  excitatory input. Finally, we present a reduced pyramidal cell model (9 compartments) that runs 
  	  significantly faster yet faithfully reproduces the behavior of the full 400 compartment model. 
  	  The reduced model will be used for future physiological network simulations.</p>

  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Compartmental models were used to determine whether ultrastructural details 
  	  of primary afferent neurons in the vestibular macula provide salient information for 
  	  understanding cell function. Precise dimensions of primary afferent endings and the location of 
  	  synapses were used as pararneters in computer simulations of passive current spread through the 
  	  distal endings and action potential (AP) generation at the spike initiation zone (SIZ). It was 
  	  demonstrated that synapse location and number, the morphology of the entire primary afferent and 
  	  the morphology of collateral like processes had significant effects on depolarization magnitude 
  	  and latency at the SIZ, thus deterrnining AP generation and latency. CNS*92 Abstract (50-100

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Integration of synchronous and asynchronous synaptic inputs in a detailed<br />
      compartmental model of the cerebellar Purkinje cell.</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> A detailed compartmental model of the Purkinje cell was used to examine 
  	  integration of synchronous granule cell synaptic inputs during background asynchronous 
  	  excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. For a synchronous input on about 1% of the dendritic 
  	  spines, the cell will fire on average one spike within 10 ms after the stimulus. This response 
  	  is similar for inputs on proximal dendritic spines compared to inputs on distal spines. This 
  	  insensitivity to the spatial location of synchronous inputs is caused by the P-type calcium 
  	  channels in the dendritic membrane and by the branching pattern of the dendritic arbor.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Self-teaching through correlated input</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> How do cells in higher order sensory areas develop their invariant 
  	  properties? In previous work we have shown that competitive learning coupled with a top-down 
  	  teaching signal can produce compact invariant representations. In this paper we show that such a 
  	  teaching signal can be derived internally from correlations between input patterns to two or 
  	  more networks. Such correlations arise naturally from the structure present in natural 
  	  environments. We demonstrate this process on two small but computationally difficult problems. 
  	  We hypothesize that the correlations between and within sensory systems enable the learning of 
  	  invariant properties.</p>

  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Novel visual stimuli are associated with saccadic eye movements. During

  	  reward-related activation of the nigrostriatal dopamine system incrementally reinforces 
  	  currently active visuo-striatal synapses. Striatum also receives input from FEF, and inhibits 
  	  substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). SNr inhibits thalamic nuclei that project to FEF. 
  	  Striatum assists activation of FEF via disinhibition of cortico-thalamic circuits. Presentation 
  	  of a learned visual stimulus results in disinhibition of the thalamo-cortical circuit for the 
  	  associated saccade. Background FEF activity is enhanced by the disinhibited thalamo-cortical 
  	  circuit, resulting in the correct saccade.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Dynamics of hebbian learning in feedback networks and development of 
  	  interconnection within visual cortex</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Two kinds of dynamic processes take place in neural networks. One involves 
  	  the change with time of the activity of each neuron. The other involves the change in strength 
  	  of the connections (synapses) between neurons. When a neural network is learning or developing, 
  	  both processes simultaneously take place, and their dynamics interact. This interaction is 
  	  particularly important in feedback networks. Theoretical framework is developed to help 
  	  understand the combined activity and synapse dynamics for a class of such adaptive networks. The 
  	  methods and viewpoint are illustrated by using them to describe the development of orientation 
  	  selective cells in cat primary visual cortex. Within this model, orientation selectivity 
  	  originates from feedback pathways within an area of cortex, rather than feedforward pathways 
  	  between areas.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Unsupervised Learning of Simple Speech Production Based on Soft 
  	  Categorization</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> In this paper a novel approach to the self-organization of a sensory-motor 
  	  loop is proposed. A neural network receiving spectra of stationary signals as input and 
  	  producing the motor parameters for an articulatory model is trained to reproduce perceived 
  	  vowels. Learning consists of two components. First, categorization in alayer that gradually 
  	  learns to compress inputs into more and more unitized responses (soft competitive learning). 
  	  Secondly, adaptation of the weights between this and the output layer, taking as learning rate a 
  	  measure of goodness-of-fit easily computed for each response in the categorization layer. The 
  	  model learns by exploring the possible articulatory space - random, at first, then increasingly 
  	  guided by the categorical repsonses - and adpating its weights when a signal, produced by 
  	  itself, has a large goodness-of-fit with one of the learned categories.</p>

  	  Vertebrate Ear</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> The network modeling program SPICE was used to realize a model of hair-cell 
  	  membrane dynamics and their role in the tuning processes of lower vertebrates. Driving the 
  	  modeled system with sinusoidal strain, we observed the transfer relationship between strain and 
  	  membrane potential. The observed transfer relation was of low dynamic order and was not 
  	  consistent with the transfer relations we have seen in intact end-organs of the bullfrog. Hence 
  	  we suspect the tuning involves interactions between several hair-cells, perhaps facilitated by 
  	  mechanical linkages. (Work supported by NIH grant DC00112.)</p>

  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> A mathematical model of the olfactory bulb is presented to study the

  	  conncetions. Coexistence between oscillation and chaos, and synaptic modification induced 
  	  transition have also been found.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> A Critical Comparison of Models of Cortical Visual Map Formation</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> High-resolution images of orientation and ocular dominance columns in monkey 
  	  striate cortex have recently been obtained by optical techniques, allowing a quantitative 
  	  description of the spatial patterns on the local and global scales. The new data has provided 
  	  strong evidence that the patterns of orientation and ocular dominance in monkey striate cortex 
  	  are not independent, but rather correlated locally. In our contribution we compare the 
  	  predictions of several models of cortical map formation, in light of the new data. The 
  	  comparison is made in terms of Fourier transforms, auto-correlation functions, Gabor transforms, 
  	  and the gradients of the spatial patterns. Our investigation includes topology-preserving maps 
  	  and elastic-net models, models of correlation-based learning, and non-developmental pattern 
  	  models. When possible, the models are also extended to account for the simultaneous formation of 
  	  orientation and ocular dominance columns, and hence to allow predictions about correlations 
  	  between the two maps.</p>

  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> We implement a detailed, realistic neural simulation using an objectoriented

  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> We present computer simulations of how the visual cortex may discriminate 
  	  objects based on depth-from-occlusion. We propose neural mechanisms for how the visual system 
  	  binds edges into contours, and binds contours and surfaces into objects. The model is simulated 
  	  by a system of physiologically-based neural networks which feature feedback connections from 
  	  higher to lower cortical areas, a distributed representation of depth, and phase-locked cortical 
  	  neuronal firing. The system demonstrates psychophysical properties consistent with human 
  	  perception of real and illusory visual scenes. The model addresses both the binding problem and 
  	  the problem of object segmentation.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> The 'Ideal Homunculus': statistical inference from neural population 
  	  responses</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> An 'ideal homunculus' makes inference about the stimulus based on the 
  	  responses of a group of neurons. The tuning curves of individual neurons can be interpreted as a 
  	  conditional probability distribution (response | stimulus). The Bayes rule can be used to 
  	  calculate the distribution of possible stimuli given the recorded response, (stimulus | response). 
  	  Combining responses from more than one neuron 'sharpens' the distribution, and the information 
  	  content of the individual contributions can be calculated. The homunculus can be looking at 
  	  groups of neurons at different levels; an example is given where orientation is inferred from 
  	  responses of V1 neurons.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Matching neural models to experiment</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Methods of quantitatively fitting single compartment neuron models to 
  	  experimentally observed neuron behavior in current clamp are investigated. Standard minimization 
  	  techniques relying on gradient information are not useful for matching Hodgkin and Huxley style 
  	  models to current clamp data. It is, however, possible to fit current clamp data with minimal 
  	  experimental information by making use of channel kinetics descriptions taken from the 
  	  literature. The fitting procedure uses random search and an appropriately defined metric. This 
  	  approach eases the task of creating neuron models for use in network simulations. Random search 
  	  may also be used to operate on simplified channel kinetics in order to create accurate matches 
  	  with experimental data. The resulting fits to experiment are not unique and therefore the 
  	  utility of the models must be judged in terms of their ability to represent important aspects of 
  	  observed neuronal behavior over wide ranges of inputs.</p>

  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> A model of cortical associative memory, based on Hebb's theory of cell 
  	  assemblies, has been developed and simulated. The network is comprised of realistically modelled 
  	  pyramidal-type cells and inhibitory fast spiking interneurons and its connectivity is adopted 
  	  from a trained recurrent artificial neural network. After-activity, pattern completion and 
  	  competition between cell assemblies is readily produced. If, instead of pyramidal cells, motor 
  	  neurons are used, spike synchronization can be observed but after-activity is hard to produce. 
  	  After-activity is facilitated by increased levels of serotonin and disrupted by low levels. Our 
  	  results support the biological plausibility of Hebb's cell assembly theory.</p>

  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> The roles that a variety of different neuronal types play in the muscle 
  	  stretch reflex have been investigated by means of a dynamic computer simulation. The simulated 
  	  reflex circuit controlled two antagonistic muscles acting on a load. Simulation results revealed 
  	  that while the dynamic component of the Group 1a afferent firing rate was important for good 
  	  dynamic response, it also caused oscillations in the load position at a frequency similar to the 
  	  condition known as clonus. If Group II afferents also excited the motoneurones, these 
  	  oscillations were reduced. Inhibition from Renshaw cells and Group 1b afferents greatly 
  	  increased the stability of the circuit.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Network Model of the Respiratory Rhythm</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> We propose a model for the generation of the respiratory rhythm. The model 
  	  is composed of four distinct neuron types recorded in vivo in the cat, defined by their phase 
  	  relationship to the respiratory cycle as seen in the phrenic neurogram. It is proposed that the 
  	  respiratory rhythm emerges from the connectivity and membrane dynamics of these neurons. 
  	  Computational models are created of the four cell types using Hodgkin-Huxley form kinetics to 
  	  describe active membrane properties that are then tuned to reproduce the recorded patterns of 
  	  neuronal behavior. The neurons are reciprocally connected with inhibitory synapses. Simulation 
  	  results accurately reproduce the three-phased respiratory cycle, and demonstrate the way in 
  	  which this activity may arise from intrinsic membrane, as well as network, properties.</p>

  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> We have developed a technique to determine the natural frequencies of 
  	  biological oscillators and have shown that these frequencies have physiological significance. We 
  	  passed both sub-threshold and supra-threshold sinusoidal current of several frequencies into the 
  	  Hodgkin-Huxley mathematical model of the squid axon (Hodgkin and Huxley 1952). The resonance 
  	  peaks for the resulting membrane potential associated with these two experiments occurred at 68 
  	  Hz and 174 Hz. These frequencies compare favorably to the range of firing frequencies (68 Hz to 
  	  169 Hz) of the Hodgkin-Huxley model response to constant current. We have also used this 
  	  resonance technique to find a resonance peak at approximately 1 Hz in the membrane potential of 
  	  a leech motor neuron which agrees with the normal swimming frequency of the leech (Pearce and 
  	  Friesen 1985, Kristan et al. 1974). correspondence should be addressed to:</p></li>
