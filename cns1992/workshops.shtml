  	<h2>The Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting</h2>
  	
  	<h3>July 1992, San Francisco, California</h3>
  	
  	<h4>CNS*1992 Workshops</h4>
  	
  	<p>The Post-meeting workshops will be held at the Marconi Conference Center near Marshall 
  	California. The workshops will provide an opportunity for conference participants to informally 
  	discuss important issues in computational neuroscience. Workshop attendance will be limited to 85, 
  	so it is important to register early.</p>
  	
  	<h4>Workshop Topics</h4>
  	
  	<p>Workshop topics will be established in one of two ways:</p>
  	
  	<ol>
  	  <li>Meeting participants interested in particular subjects can submit those subjects prior to 
  	  the meeting (see addresses below). Suggestions should include the title of the workshop, a brief 
  	  abstract describing the issue(s) involved, and any other meeting attendees known to be 
  	  interested in participating.</li>
  	  <li>Workshop subjects can also be suggested during the main meeting. We are particularly 
  	  interested in topics that arise as a result of meeting presentations.</li>
  	</ol>
  	
  	<p>A bulletin board at the meeting will be used for participant sign-up. The bulletin board will 
  	list all suggested workshops as well as those that have signed up.</p>
  	
  	<h4>Workshop Structure</h4>
  	
  	<p>The workshops themselves will be conducted as informal discussions. Large paper tablets will be 
  	available. The use of slides or overheads, however, will be discouraged. Each workshop group will 
  	be asked to appoint a secretary to keep track of the relevant questions and discussion points. 
  	Particular attention should be paid to the relevant &quot;open&quot; questions on the particular 
  	issue being discussed. Evening sessions will be organized for Each workshop will report its 
  	results to the entire group in after dinner sessions. Brief summaries of workshop results will be 
  	published in the conference proceedings.</p>
  	
  	<h4>Workshop Location:</h4>
  	
  	<p>All workshops and lodging for participants will be at the Marconi Conference Center. This state 
  	run center is located on the Pacific coast near the small town of Marshall California. It sits on 
  	the bluffs above Tomales Bay and includes many beautiful views. There are several nice walking 
  	trails within the site, including a trail to the &quot;historic&quot; cement foundations of the 
  	large transmission tower that Marconi built for transoceanic communication. In addition there are 
  	trails to the shoreline. In general, this part of California is a wonderful location for short car 
  	trips up or down the coast which includes several small coastal towns with great seafood 
  	restaurants, antique shops, etc. The conference center itself is quite beautiful with nice lounges 
  	for informal gatherings at all hours. The lodging rooms are also quite comfortable.</p>
  	
  	<h4>Logistical Arrangements</h4>
  	
  	<p>All participants will be housed at the Marconi Center. Meals will be provided and the food 
  	service is quite good. Transportation will be arranged to and from the main meeting location in 
  	San Francisco.</p>
  	
  	<p>No smoking is permitted in any of the buildings. Because the center is located on the coast, 
  	the weather can be cool even in July. Accordingly, one should bring several layers of clothing.</p>
