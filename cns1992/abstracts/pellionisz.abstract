A most important basic research goal of neurocomputing is to identify, from biological neural nets, the mathematics intrinsic to neural net function. From up to ten cerebellar Purkinje cells of locomotory cats, multi-electrode recordings were obtained and the geometry of the functional manifold was calculated. The covariant metric tensor was calculated by cross-correlation analysis and the contravariant metric tensor was obtained by its Moore-Penrose inverse. For adequate analysis of massively parallel data, a transputer-based neurocomputer was built. Results demonstrate the non-Euclidean neural geometry and its modifiability with learning. Identification of geometry permits decoding, of external invariants (distances) from neural firings.
