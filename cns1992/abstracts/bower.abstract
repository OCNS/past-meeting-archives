A Silicon-based multi-single neuron probe designed for use in the cerebellum


James M. Bower and John H. Thompson


We have developed a silicon-based multichannel recording system for monitoring the single-unit activity of multiple neurons in the cerebellum. The system consists of a 15 channel multielectrode array, supporting electronics, and computers for data acquisition and analysis. The probe is a comb-like structure with 5 teeth and 3 recording sites per tooth. The geometry of the recording sites has been tailored to the anatomy of cerebellar cortex. Each tooth is very sharp and enters the brain with little or no dimpling. Recording sites, connecting leads, and wire-bonding pads are fabricated on a silicon substrate using thin-film technology. These probes have been used to record spontaneous granule cell, simple spike and complex spike responses in crus lla of the rat cerebellar hemisphere with excellent signal to noise characteristics.
