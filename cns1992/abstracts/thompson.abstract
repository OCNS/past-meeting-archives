 	 We have used our knowledge of the detailed pattern of tactile mossy
 fiber projections to the granule cell layers of crus IIa to look at the
 effects of the three major inputs on Purkinje cells. Our results show that
 Purkinje cell responses to brief peripheral stimuli consist of a short
 latency (5-8 ms), short duration (15 ms) component and a longer latency
 prolonged (100-400 ms) increase in simple spike activity. Our data
 suggest that these can be attributed to the ascending portion and the
 parallel fibers of the granule cell axon respectively. Also, we have used
 spike separation techniques to separate these granule cell effects from
 those of the climbing fiber system.

 	Experiments in our and other laboratories have described the spatial
 organization of tactile mossy fiber projections to the granule cell layer of
 crus IIa of rat cerebellar cortex.  Using high density micro-mapping techniques, 
it has been shown that the perioral regions are represented by a
 fractured somatotopic map. That is, there are patches within whose
 boundaries a region of the rat's face is somatotopically mapped. At patch
 boundaries, however, there are discontinuities after which a new, not necessarily 
peripherally adjoining region is mapped. The granule cells which
 receive these inputs project to the molecular layer which contains the
 dendrites of the Purkinje cells. In this layer the granule cell axons
 bifurcate forming the parallel fibers which run parallel to each other for
 several millimeters across patch boundaries contacting numerous
 Purkinje cells along their length. Bower and Woolston (1983) found that
 the shortest latency tactile projections to the Purkinje cells in this
 region were spatially congruent to those in the granule cell layer. That is,
 activated Purkinje cells were directly over activated granule cells. This
 suggested that the ascending portion of the granule cell axon (which
 synapses on Purkinje cells on the way up) was responsible for this short
 latency response. 
 	In these experiments we record from a Purkinje cell while stimulating
 perioral regions projecting to the underlying granule cells, constructing a
 peri-stimulus time histogram (PST) from the spikes recorded from 300
 trials. Then, the stimulus is moved to other regions which project to
 patches in the same folium but removed from the Purkinje cell.  In
 separate trials, both regions which send parallel fibers to the Purkinje
 cell and some which don't are stimulated. Comparing the PSTs from the
 various trials, we conclude that the short latency excitatory response is
 mediated by the input from the ascending portion of the granule cell axon
 only. There is a prolonged, longer latency response starting approximately
 40 ms after the stimulus and lasting for 100 to 400 ms which is mediated
 by the parallel fibers. There is little or no response to stimuli in regions
 not connected by the parallel fibers. Lastly, we are able to discriminate
 between the simple spikes in Purkinje cells generated by the two granule
 cell inputs and the complex spikes generated by the other input pathway,
 the climbing fibers from the inferior olive. We have not been able to
 statistically link the climbing fiber pathway to the generation of either
 the short or long latency responses.
 	The results of these experiments are studied in the context of a new
 interpretation of the functional significance of cerebellar cortical
 architecture. Purkinje cells respond to specific information relayed via
 the ascending branch in the context of more subtle modulation provided by
 the parallel fibers. This allows a new understanding of the fractured
 somatotopic organization of mossy fiber projections.
