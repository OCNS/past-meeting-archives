90% of the abstracts are now available for FTP in this
directory. The remainder will be in place at the begining of
next week.

Abstracts are listed according to the first author.  The other
authors and the institution(s) from which the abstract came
are indicated in the text of each abstract.

Authors who wish to upgrade or revise their abstracts should send
email to this effect to:

cns92@cns.caltech.edu

We will not be publishing the abstracts, but will make them
available electronically at the meeting itself.  We will also
provide printing facilities.
