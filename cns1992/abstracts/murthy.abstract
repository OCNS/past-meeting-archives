ABSTRACT: We studied the dependence of the average spike frequency (f-out) of a biophysically realistic model neuron on the degree of synchrony (s, varied from 0 to 100%) in its excitatory synaptic inputs. The following independent parameters were systematically varied: (1) N, the number of inputs to the neuron, (2) f-in, the average frequency of the inputs, and (3) w, the strength of the input connection. The goal was to empirically determine the relation: f-out = F(N, fin, w, s). The results indicate that for parameter values in the range found in neocortical cells, input synchrony can affect output significantly.
