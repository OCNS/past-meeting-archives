                               ABSTRACT

Visual attention is the ability to dynamically restrict processing to
a subset of the visual field.  Such a mechanism is necessary to
efficiently perform many intermediate level visual tasks.  This
presentation describes VISIT a novel neural network model of covert
visual attention.  The current system models the search for target
objects in scenes containing multiple distractors.  This is a natural
task for people, it is studied extensively by psychologists, and it
requires attention.  The network's behavior closely matches the known
psychophysical data on visual search and visual attention.  VISIT also
matches much of the physiological data on attention and provides a
novel view of the functionality of a number of visual areas.

Overview of the Valentino
Computational Neuroscience Workbench for Simulation of
Neural Systems

Abstract

We present an innovative simulator system designed to facilitate
research in computational neuroscience. The Valentino Computational
Neuroscience Workbench (CNW) incorporates an object-oriented design
and a neuroscience workbench metaphor wherein a number of independent
tools manipulate a shared persistent simulation structure. Central to
the system is a novel tool for configuring structured neural networks
using a graphical user-interface and powerful interconnection
selection criteria and schema. Together these make the Valentino CNW
powerful, flexible, extendible and, yet, still easy-to-use - unlike
some other presently available simulators.

RECURRENT BACKPROPAGATION MODELS 
OF THE VESTIBULO-OCULAR REFLEX 
PROVIDE EXPERIMENTALLY TESTABLE PREDICTIONS
Thomas J. Anastasio

Previous,  static  backpropagation  models   of   the   vestibulo-
oculomotor system were able to capture the distributed aspects of 
eye-movement  command  representation   by   brainstem   neurons.
However, these models do not readily offer testable  predictions.
More recently, recurrent backpropagation models have been used to 
study the dynamic and nonlinear features of the  vestibulo-ocular
reflex (VOR).  The dynamic models make clear predictions  concern-
ing the behavior of VOR neurons following lesions.  Some  of  the
predictions from the recurrent backpropagation models  differ  in
critical ways from those derived from analytical models  of  VOR.
The testability of the recurrent models  encourages  a  continued
dialog between theory and experiment.

Abstract

Directed visual attention can be modeled by neural routing circuits
that provide high-level areas of the visual cortex with dynamic access
to retinal sensory inputs. This approach has many computational
advantages over the more static, feedforward models of vision which
construct increasingly more complex receptive fields as one moves
upward through the hierarchy of cortical areas. Here, we provide
details on the structure of neural routing circuits and their control
as illustrated by interactive computer programs. Neural substrates for
routing and control are proposed and physiological support for the
model is discussed.

Abstract

The dynamical behaviour of neural networks is typically considered to be
controlled by the synaptic weights and by the neurons' thresholds. Recently,
it was suggested that the network's activity can be modified by solely mod-
ulating the neuronal activation function. We examine the effect of modula-
tory neurotransmitter on the behavior of a simple excitatory neural network
model by varying the neuronal gain. The network passes through several
qualitatively distinct regions of activity, traversing from a uni-steady state
to a multi-steady state region, and back to a region of a small number of
steady states. Our results may shed light on the possible regulatory role of
dopamine in the cortico-striato-pallido-thalamic loop, and the effects of its
malfunction in the pathogenesis of movement related disorders.

Numerical simulations of the electric organ discharge of weakly electric fish.

Christopher Assad, Brian Rasnow, James M. Bower


A model of a weakly electric fish was constructed with data taken from
Apteronotus leptorhynchus, and the electric organ discharge was
simulated using boundary element and finite element methods. Maps of
the electric potential measured around a live fish were used to
calibrate the model parameters and test the results. Initial results
suggest the fish's body position has a significant effect on the
electrical images detected by the fish. Our goal is to quantitatively
simulate various sequences of electrosensory input being sent to the
central nervous system as the result of the fish's exploratory
behavior.

A STUDY OF COMPUTATION IN A SIMPLE NEURONAL NETWORK: EXPERIMENTAL RECORDING
AND THEORETICAL SIMULATION OF THE IMMATURE RAT CEREBELLAR CORTEX.

Experimental and theoretical analysis of the 5-7 days old rat
cerebellar cortex (Cbcx) was undertaken to get some insight on the
role of inhibition in modulating the ongoing activity and the spatial
distribution of functionally correlated neurons. Pairs of Purkinje
cells (PC) were recorded in vivo before and after uncoupling the
inhibitory links (mediated by their recurrent collaterals) via
superfusion of biccuculin. Statistical techniques were used to assess
the characteristics and correlation of the spike trains. A new tool is
presented which computes an index of informational entropy.
Experimental results are compared with simulation results from a
biologically accurate model of this structure. It appears that
inhibition: 1- significantly changes the spike trains data; 2- it
restricts the space of states in which the network can evolve and 3-it
leads to a spatio-functional segregation of correlated PCs. The
limitations of CNS models will be discussed.

Power Spectrum Analysis of MT Neurons from the Awake Monkey

Wyeth Bair, Christof Koch, William Newsome and Kenneth Britten

January 10, 1992


We analyzed extracellular spike trains recorded from single cells in
area MT in rhesus monkeys which performed a demanding motion
discrimination task (Newsome, Britten & Movshon, 1989). In particular,
we computed the power spectra of spike trains from 2 sec long trials
of visual stimulation during which the monkey held fixation. Most
cells have a relatively flat spectrum with a dip at low frequencies,
indicative of a Poisson process with a refractory period. 10% of cells
have a substantial peak in the spectrum between 25-50~z, but the
presence and strength of this peak does not correlate in any way with
the know behavior of the monkey (e.g. correct or incorrect decision).
However, there exists a very strong correlation between cells that
discharge 2-4 spikes within 37msec (burst cells) and cells that have a
peak in the power spectrum. The simplest interpretation of this data
is that a small fraction of cells randomly and independently of the
stimulus fire in bursts followed by a refractory period, giving rise
to a peak near 40Hz in the power spectrum.

This paper describes an auto-associative memory system, which is
based on a combination of the Bidirectional Associative Memory
(BAM) architecture and the use of randomly generated hidden
representations called Randomized Internal Representations.  The
capacity and recall performance of the proposed system have been
investigated under reduced connectivity and noise conditions.
Analytical and simulation results suggested that the proposed system
has an overall improved performance over other auto-associator
networks.  A multi-layer version of the basic system allows for storage
and recall of non-random patterns.  The system is capable of detecting
novelty in the input when augmented with a plasticity-stability control
mechanism.  There is a number of functional and anatomical
similarities between the proposed multi-layer system and the
hippocampal formation in the brain.

Abstract
--------

We describe an adaptive computer model of processing in the mammalian visual
system, from retina to primary visual cortex, which incorporates: processing
in retina and LGN; Non-negative neuron outputs and connection strengths;
On-center and off-center channels; Excitatory and inhibitory cortical
populations (3750 neurons); Non-linear cortical neurons, based on membrane
potential and relaxation oscillator equations; Adaptive cortical connections.

With images of the real world as input, the model robustly and simultaneously
develops: oriented receptive field patterns, Gabor function-like fields,
smoothly-varying orientation preference, and retinotopic mapping.
Experiments with this and related models suggest the same mechanism may
produce ocular dominance, and possibly color blobs.

Self-organising ion channel densities: the rationale for Anti-Hebb

(tony@arti.vub.ac.be) 

Although neural communication and integration are determined by the
distribution of ion channels in the membrane, the role of voltage-dependent
channels in neural integration is poorly understood.
Here, an argument is presented for an `anti-Hebbian' rule which changes the
distribution of intrinsic conductances in order to flatten voltage
curvatures in dendrites. Simulations show that this rule can account for
the self-organisation of dynamical receptive field properties such as
resonance and direction selectivity, and also for faithful conduction
of a signal in a cable. Various cellular mechanisms are proposed
including activity-dependent migration of channel proteins in the plane of
the membrane.

ABSTRACT


A correlational-based model of development of disparity sensitivity is
proposed. Two input layers are fully connected to a single cortical
layer with fixed intra-cortical connections, and the weights modified
by an unsupervised linear Hebb rule. A small amount of between-eye
correlation (approximately 5% the amplitude of the same-eye
correlation) leads to the development of binocular cortical cells with
the left and right receptive fields aligned, i.e. zero disparity.
Several cells which become monocularly dominated tend to have non-zero
disparity preferences. The same relationship between ocular dominance
and disparity has been experimentally observed in the visual cortex.

Continuing previous research, several new detailed compartment models of
cerebellar networks were developed based on new data from extra-cellular
recordings in rabbit during conditioning of the eyeblink response. New sites
of synaptic plasticity were postulated, as suggested by recent cooling-probe
experiments, and these were incorporated into the models. The models were
tested by simulation using the CAJAL simulator, which produces action
potential spike trains that can be compared against the experimental
time-trace data.  Effects of cooling-induced lesions are simulated by
varying certain parameters in the model neurons implicated by the lesion
experiments.  Conditioning is simulated by varying parameters in the model
synapses of neurons implicated by these same experiments in a series of
computer runs simulating training trials. Results provide further evidence
that these cerebellar circuits may be the main neural substrates of this
conditioning paradigm.

We consider the non-linear spatio-temporal computation of directional
selectivity (DS), and describe a model of retinal DS whose key
elements are contained within the dendritic branches of amacrine
cells. Interaction between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input
provides the non-linearity crucial for DS.  Distal outputs, cable
properties and synaptic kinetics underly spatial asymmetry,
discrimination, and temporal delay, respectively.  The model is
supported by simulations of retinal cells and is consistent with
recent electrophysiological data.  Similar conditions may occur
elsewhere in the brain, and simulations of hippocampal pyramidal cells
suggest that dendritic filtering that is selective for synaptic
activation sequence may be a more general phenomenon.

A Silicon-based multi-single neuron probe designed for use in the cerebellum


James M. Bower and John H. Thompson


We have developed a silicon-based multichannel recording system for
monitoring the single-unit activity of multiple neurons in the
cerebellum. The system consists of a 15 channel multielectrode array,
supporting electronics, and computers for data acquisition and
analysis. The probe is a comb-like structure with 5 teeth and 3
recording sites per tooth. The geometry of the recording sites has
been tailored to the anatomy of cerebellar cortex. Each tooth is very
sharp and enters the brain with little or no dimpling. Recording
sites, connecting leads, and wire-bonding pads are fabricated on a
silicon substrate using thin-film technology. These probes have been
used to record spontaneous granule cell, simple spike and complex
spike responses in crus lla of the rat cerebellar hemisphere with
excellent signal to noise characteristics.

Functional relations between cortical sites were investigated in the
behaving monkey. Transcortical field potentials were recorded from
chronically implanted electrodes in macaques responding to one
stimulus by lifting their hand from a lever within 500 msec (GO task),
and to another by holding the lever (NO-GO task). FFTs of single-trial
potentials were computed in a sliding window. Broad-band power
increased during the response in the GO condition timelocked across
cortical sites, and broad-band coherence between sites also increased.
In individual trials, high-frequency oscillations briefly synchronized
at the low-frequency amplitude peak.

Abstract

Despite their electrotonic compactness, neocortical pyramidal cells
cannot be considered as point neurons because of nonlinear
interactions between inputs on the same dendritic branch. Using
compartmental simulations, we have shown that dendritic saturation is
significant for physiological levels of synaptic activation. We have
also confirmed earlier results showing that inhibition strong enough
to produce a significant reduction in the input resistance of a cell
does not prevent the firing of the cell if it is receiving strong
excitatory input. Finally, we present a reduced pyramidal cell model
(9 compartments) that runs significantly faster yet faithfully
reproduces the behavior of the full 400 compartment model. The reduced
model will be used for future physiological network simulations.

ABSTRACT

Compartmental models were used to determine whether ultrastructural
details of primary afferent neurons in the vestibular macula provide
salient information for understanding cell function.  Precise
dimensions of primary afferent endings and the location of synapses
were used as pararneters in computer simulations of passive current
spread through the distal endings and action potential (AP) generation
at the spike initiation zone (SIZ). It was demonstrated that synapse
location and number, the morphology of the entire primary afferent and
the morphology of collateral like processes had significant effects on
depolarization magnitude and latency at the SIZ, thus deterrnining AP
generation and latency.  CNS*92 Abstract (50-100 words - For

A Model of the Peristaltic Reflex.

A computational model of the peristaltic reflex containing ascending
excitatory and descending inhibitory projections replicated much of
the behaviour observed experimentally after reflex activation,
including: i. orally directed contraction and anally directed
relaxation of the circular muscle, ii. the induction of a propagating
circular muscle contraction associated with bolus movement. Simulation
results showed bolus movement to be: i. restricted by limiting the
number of times sensory neurones could generate an action potential,
ii. sensitive to its size and asymmetric weight distributions biased
in favour of excitatory pathways, iii. maintained with overlapping
projections only when the excitatory projections extended anally.

Integration of synchronous and asynchronous synaptic inputs in a detailed 
compartmental model of the cerebellar Purkinje cell.

Erik De Schutter and James M. Bower, Div. of Biology 216-76, California 
Institute of Technology, Pasadena CA 91125.

ABSTRACT

A detailed compartmental model of the Purkinje cell was used to
examine integration of synchronous granule cell synaptic inputs during
background asynchronous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs.
For a synchronous input on about 1% of the dendritic spines, the cell
will fire on average one spike within 10 ms after the stimulus.  This
response is similar for inputs on proximal dendritic spines compared
to inputs on distal spines.  This insensitivity to the spatial
location of synchronous inputs is caused by the P-type calcium
channels in the dendritic membrane and by the branching pattern of the
dendritic arbor.

Abstract

How do cells in higher order sensory areas develop their invariant
properties? In previous work we have shown that competitive learning
coupled with a top-down teaching signal can produce compact invariant
representations. In this paper we show that such a teaching signal can
be derived internally from correlations between input patterns to two
or more networks. Such correlations arise naturally from the structure
present in natural environments. We demonstrate this process on two
small but computationally difficult problems. We hypothesize that the
correlations between and within sensory systems enable the learning
of invariant properties.

Abstract:  Novel visual stimuli are associated with saccadic eye movements.

During learning, a visual stimulus is presented with a saccade target.
Following a correct saccade, reward-related activation of the
nigrostriatal dopamine system incrementally reinforces currently
active visuo-striatal synapses.  Striatum also receives input from
FEF, and inhibits substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr).  SNr
inhibits thalamic nuclei that project to FEF.

Striatum assists activation of FEF via disinhibition of
cortico-thalamic circuits.  Presentation of a learned visual stimulus
results in disinhibition of the thalamo-cortical circuit for the
associated saccade.  Background FEF activity is enhanced by the
disinhibited thalamo-cortical circuit, resulting in the correct
saccade.

 DYNAMICS OF HEBBIAN LEARNING IN FEEDBACK NETWORKS AND

Two kinds of dynamic processes take place in neural networks.
One involves the change with time of the activity of each neuron.
The other involves the change in strength of the connections
(synapses) between neurons.  When a neural network is learning or
developing, both processes simultaneously take place, and their
dynamics interact.  This interaction is particularly important in
feedback networks.  Theoretical framework is developed to help
understand the combined activity and synapse dynamics for a class
of such adaptive networks.  The methods and viewpoint are illustrated
by using them to describe the development of orientation selective
cells in cat primary visual cortex. Within this model, orientation
selectivity originates from feedback pathways within an area of cortex,
rather than feedforward pathways between areas.

Unsupervised Learning of Simple Speech Production
Based on Soft Categorization

Dept.of Medical Cybernetics and Artificial Intelligence, University

and Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence

Abstract

In this paper a novel approach to the self-organization of a
sensory-motor loop is proposed. A neural network receiving spectra of
stationary signals as input and producing the motor parameters for an
articulatory model is trained to reproduce perceived vowels. Learning
consists of two components.  First, categorization in alayer that
gradually learns to compress inputs into more and more unitized
responses (soft competitive learning).  Secondly, adaptation of the
weights between this and the output layer, taking as learning rate a
measure of goodness-of-fit easily computed for each response in the
categorization layer. The model learns by exploring the possible
articulatory space - random, at first, then increasingly guided by the
categorical repsonses - and adpating its weights when a signal,
produced by itself, has a large goodness-of-fit with one of the
learned categories.

Hair-Cell Modelling to Explore the Physiological Basis of Tuning
in the Lower Vertebrate Ear

by David Egert,  U.C. Berkeley/U.C. San Francisco Graduate Group
in Bioengineering


Abstract

     The network modeling program SPICE was used to realize a
model of hair-cell membrane dynamics and their role in the tuning
processes of lower vertebrates.  Driving the modeled system with
sinusoidal strain, we observed the transfer relationship between
strain and membrane potential.  The observed transfer relation
was of low dynamic order and was not consistent with the transfer
relations we have seen in intact end-organs of the bullfrog.
Hence we suspect the tuning involves interactions between several
hair-cells, perhaps facilitated by mechanical linkages.  (Work

 A Critical Comparison of Models of Cortical Visual Map Formation

Beckman Institute and Department of Physics
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
Urbana, IL61801,U.S.A.


   High-resolution images of orientation and ocular dominance
columns in monkey striate cortex have recently been obtained by
optical techniques, allowing a quantitative description of the
spatial patterns on the local and global scales.  The new data has
provided strong evidence that the patterns of orientation and ocular
dominance in monkey striate cortex are not independent, but rather
correlated locally.

In our contribution we compare the predictions of several models of
cortical map formation, in light of the new data.  The comparison is
made in terms of Fourier transforms, auto-correlation functions,
Gabor transforms, and the gradients of the spatial patterns.  Our
investigation includes topology-preserving maps and elastic-net
models, models of correlation-based learning, and non-developmental
pattern models.  When possible, the models are also extended to
account for the simultaneous formation of orientation and ocular
dominance columns, and hence to allow predictions about correlations
between the two maps.

Abstract

We implement a detailed, realistic neural simulation using an objectoriented
programming paradigm incorporating the known properties of biological
neurons. The object-oriented design eliminates many of the complexities
typical of a conventional modeling approach. Our model allows implementation
of multiple integration algorithms which can be selected interchangeably by
the user. Descriptions of physiological objects are supported at several
hierarchical levels, from networks to neurons, membrane compartments, and
ionic channels. Our design provides the flexibility to incorporate new
physiological features and numerical algorithms with fault-tolerant

ABSTRACT


We present computer simulations of how the visual cortex may
discriminate objects based on depth-from-occlusion. We propose neural
mechanisms for how the visual system binds edges into contours, and
binds contours and surfaces into objects. The model is simulated by a
system of physiologically-based neural networks which feature feedback
connections from higher to lower cortical areas, a distributed
representation of depth, and phase-locked cortical neuronal firing.
The system demonstrates psychophysical properties consistent with
human perception of real and illusory visual scenes. The model
addresses both the binding problem and the problem of object
segmentation.

neurons can be interpreted as a conditional probability distribution
(response | stimulus).  The Bayes rule can be used to calculate the
distribution of possible stimuli given the recorded response,
(stimulus | response). Combining responses from more than one neuron
'sharpens' the distribution, and the information content of the
individual contributions can be calculated. The homunculus can be
looking at groups of neurons at different levels; an example is given
where orientation is inferred from responses of V1 neurons.

Methods of quantitatively fitting single compartment neuron models to
experimentally observed neuron behavior in current clamp are
investigated.  Standard minimization techniques relying on gradient
information are not useful for matching Hodgkin and Huxley style
models to current clamp data.  It is, however, possible to fit current
clamp data with minimal experimental information by making use of
channel kinetics descriptions taken from the literature.  The fitting
procedure uses random search and an appropriately defined metric.
This approach eases the task of creating neuron models for use in
network simulations.  Random search may also be used to operate on
simplified channel kinetics in order to create accurate matches with
experimental data.  The resulting fits to experiment are not unique and
therefore the utility of the models must be judged in terms of their
ability to represent important aspects of observed neuronal behavior
over wide ranges of inputs.

A model of cortical associative memory, based on Hebb's theory of cell
assemblies, has been developed and simulated. The network is comprised of
realistically modelled pyramidal-type cells and inhibitory fast spiking
interneurons and its connectivity is adopted from a trained recurrent
artificial neural network. After-activity, pattern completion and
competition between cell assemblies is readily produced. If, instead of
pyramidal cells, motor neurons are used, spike synchronization can be
observed but after-activity is hard to produce. After-activity is
facilitated by increased levels of serotonin and disrupted by low levels.
Our results support the biological plausibility of Hebb's cell assembly
theory.

Abstract

The roles that a variety of different neuronal types play in the muscle
stretch reflex have been investigated by means of a dynamic computer
simulation.  The simulated reflex circuit controlled two antagonistic
muscles acting on a load.  Simulation results revealed that while the
dynamic component of the Group 1a afferent firing rate was important for
good dynamic response, it also caused oscillations in the load position at a
frequency similar to the condition known as clonus.  If Group II afferents
also excited the motoneurones, these oscillations were reduced.  Inhibition
from Renshaw cells and Group 1b afferents greatly increased the stability of
the circuit.

Network Model of the Respiratory Rhythm

By E.B. GRAVES, D.W. RICHTER* AND J.S.SCHWABERl

We propose a model for the generation of the respiratory rhythm. The
model is composed of four distinct neuron types recorded in vivo in
the cat, defined by their phase relationship to the respiratory cycle
as seen in the phrenic neurogram. It is proposed that the respiratory
rhythm emerges from the connectivity and membrane dynamics of these
neurons. Computational models are created of the four cell types using
Hodgkin-Huxley form kinetics to describe active membrane properties
that are then tuned to reproduce the recorded patterns of neuronal
behavior. The neurons are reciprocally connected with inhibitory
synapses. Simulation results accurately reproduce the three-phased
respiratory cycle, and demonstrate the way in which this activity may
arise from intrinsic membrane, as well as network, properties.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract

We have developed a technique to determine the natural frequencies of
biological oscillators and have shown that these frequencies have
physiological significance. We passed both sub-threshold and
supra-threshold sinusoidal current of several frequencies into the
Hodgkin-Huxley mathematical model of the squid axon (Hodgkin and
Huxley 1952). The resonance peaks for the resulting membrane potential
associated with these two experiments occurred at 68 Hz and 174 Hz.
These frequencies compare favorably to the range of firing frequencies
(68 Hz to 169 Hz) of the Hodgkin-Huxley model response to constant
current. We have also used this resonance technique to find a
resonance peak at approximately 1 Hz in the membrane potential of a
leech motor neuron which agrees with the normal swimming frequency of
the leech (Pearce and Friesen 1985, Kristan et al. 1974).

 Directionally selective
ganglion cells respond to preferred--direction motions more strongly
than predicted by the sum of the responses to stationary stimuli
covering the same area as the motion.  The spatial, temporal, and
contrast properties of this motion facilitation were recently
investigated in rabbit by apparent--motion protocols.  These
properties are inconsistent with facilitation models based either on
threshold or membrane--conductance modulation.  However, these
properties are consistent with models in which an enhancer agent
induced by motion facilitates responses evoked later along the motion
trajectory.  The data indicate that the enhancer would itself not
produce excitation until gated by the later excitation.  Simulations
using Surf--Hippo, a new retinal simulator, support a dendritic
implementation of this ``gated--enhancer" model.

ABSTRACT

A detailed model of piriform cortex developed with the
GENESIS simulation package shows associative memory properties
such as completion.  This model allows analysis of the role of
acetylcholine in cortical associative memory function.
Experiments demonstrate that acetylcholine causes selective
suppression of synaptic transmission at excitatory intrinsic
fiber synapses in piriform cortex (Hasselmo and Bower, 1992).
When applied during learning in the model, this selective
cholinergic suppression prevents interference between
overlapping input patterns, allowing separate and distinct
learning of input stimuli.  This selective suppression may
act in concert with the cholinergic increase in excitability
to modulate piriform cortex associative memory function.

         The Neurone Describing function : A Single Compartment Study

Abstract

     In artificial neural networks, units usually perform a sigmoid
function of the weighted sum of their inputs. By Taylor series
expansion, it can be shown that these networks compute a constrained
Volterra series of their inputs. As a descriptor of real neurone
behaviour this approach fails because neurones have dynamic properties
and do not have a separate linear stage.  Using compartmental
modelling, describing functions of neurones can be approximated. This
approach demonstrates a frequency dependent non-linearity not
represented by a fixed Volterra Kernel. The simulation of real
neurones leads to the proposal of alternative describing functions for
artificial nets.

Abstract 

We study an Attractor Neural Network that stores natural concepts, organized
in semantic classes. The concepts are represented by distributed patterns
over a space of attributes, and are related by both semantic and episodic
associations. While semantic relations are expressed through an hierarchical
coding over the attribute space, episodic links are realized via specific
synaptic projections. Due to dynamic thresholds expressing neuronal fatigue,
the network's behavior is characterized by convergence toward the concept
patterns on a short time scale, and by transitions between the various
patterns on a longer time scale. The network manifests semantic, episodic,
and random transitions. Modeling pathological memory disturbances, we
studied the influence of several parameters on the frequency of semantic and
episodic transitions. W'hen neurons characterized by a large synaptic
connectivity are deleted, semantic transitions deteriorate before the
episodic ones, in accordance with the findings in patients with Alzheimer's
disease.

Abstract

A simulated model of the effects of chemical and activity-dependent
mechanisms in to- pographic map formation is presented. These
mechanisms work together to allow rapid development of detailed maps.
The model matches experimental results on the ability to form rough,
but not refined, maps in the absence of electrical activity, expansion
of heav- ily stimulated areas, and formation of ocular dominance
columns. This work explains and resolves problems with previous
models, including the need to use non-biological input
representations, slow convergence rates, and problems with orientation
and formation of discontinous sub-maps.

Abstract

Recent experimental evidence testifies to the possible role
of synaptic deletion and compensation in the pathogenesis
of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a clinical hallmark of AD
is memory degradation, these processes are examined in the
framework of a neural network model of associative mem-
ory. Using a network with fixed memory load we vary two
parameters, the deletion of synapses and the total synap-
tic strength, and observe the characteristic turnover from a
memory-retrieval phase to total memory loss. Several synap-
tic compensation strategies, that patients may employ de-
pending on their synaptic regenerative potential, are specified
and examined. Reviewing the neuroanatomical and clinical
data, we show that our model can account for the variation
in the severity and progression rate of AD.

MORPHOLOGICAL BASIS OF WIND STIMULUS DISCRIMINATION IN THE CRICKET
CERCAL SENSORY SYSTEM. Gwen Jacobs, Frederic Theunissen, Jay Levin and
Michael Landolfa, Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University
of California, Berkeley, CA 94720.

The functional organization of a sensory map in a simple insect
sensory system was studied using a combination of anatomical and
electrophysiological techniques. Analysis of the map indicates that
air current direction is represented in a continuous fashion within
the map. Directionally selective primary sensory interneurons extract
directional information from the map by virtue of the position of
their dendritic arbors within the map. To test this structure-function
hypothesis we have modeled the directional tuning curves of primary
sensory interneurons based on the anatomical relationships between the
interneurons and the map. The predicted tuning curves are very similar
to the experimentally observed curves.

Prolonged depolarizations following brief synaptic stimulations in the
cerebellar Purkinje cell: Intracellular recordings and compartmental
modelling

Dieter Jaeger, Erik De Schutter and James M. Bower, California
Institute of Technology, Div. of Biology 216-76, Pasadena CA 91125


Abstract

Intracellular recordings were obtained from Purkinje cells in the
guinea pig slice preparation. Electrical stimulation pulses of 0.1 ms
duration delivered to the granule cell layer resulted in 100 to 300 ms
lasting depolarizations in Purkinje cells. During these
depolarizations the cells often showed an increase of spiking
frequency. Pulses of synchronous synaptic activation in a
compartmental model of the Purkinje cell resulted in similar prolonged
depolarizations. In the model, prolonged depolarizations are due to
the opening of voltage dependent calcium channels. Increases of
spiking frequency with a similar time course can be observed in vivo
with brief (5ms) tactile stimulation, suggesting that the active
membrane properties of individual Purkinje cells observed in vitro and
in the model contribute to the modulatiGn of Purkinje cell activity
via the parallel fiber system in the functioning network.

We outline a theory of six-layered, homeotypic cortex that includes
mechanisms for pattern selec- tivity, hierarchical category recognition and
sequence learning. Learnable inhibitory feedback between layers of cortex
acts to shift the activation threshold for pattern-recognizing cells, caus-
ing them to become tuned to specific patterns of afferents. The final amount
of inhibition will be a function of the "size" of the pattern recognized by
the cell. The inhibition can therefore be applied to other
pattern-recognizing cells to implement a "masking field" (Grossberg, 1985).

                       Abstract


A model is presented to investigate the role of feedback pathways from
association cortical areas to Vl and LGN in attentional mechanisms. In
the model,these pathways are shown to be capable of modifying the
tuning properties of lower level neurons, hence quickening their
convergence. Model simulations use an algorithm (Alopex) that is
implementable by known neural circuitry.  The change in tuning
properties of V4 and IT neurons in the monkey has lead to the
hypothesis that these changes play a role in the static aspects of
attention. Our results show that this may instead be a dynamic
phenomenon,helping the visual system to focus attention rapidly.

NMDA-Activated Conductances Provide Short-Term Memory for Dendritic
Spine Logic Computations

06510 and Department of Physics, Wesleyan University Middletown, CT 06457


Active conductances in dendritic spines may permit elaborate computational
processing of multiple synaptic inputs long before these signals reach the
soma. Numerical models of dendritic trees indicate that the interactions of
postsynaptic potentials in active spines can generate simple logic
operations such as AND, OR and NAND gates. However, because the spine head
EPSP's closely follow the underlying, short-duration (1-3 ms), synaptic
conductances, previous studies concluded that the precise timing of synaptic
inputs is critical for these logic operations.  We show that this severe
temporal limitation on dendritic computation can be overcome by the
inclusion of slow (100-300 ms), voltage-dependent, NMDA-receptor mediated
conductances$^5$ in the spine heads.  Our numerical simulations show that
this simple mechanism provides a short term memory ($\sim$ 100 ms) for
logical AND gates with time-delayed inputs on one or more spines.

Abstract

Hippocampal granule cells from patients with certain types of temporal
lobe epilepsy have been found to exhibit abnormal electrophysiological
and pathological properties. In particular, intracellular recordings
in slice preparations from human patients with medial temporal lobe
sclerosis show an enhacement of the NMDA component of the EPSP
relative to normal human or rodent tissues.1 In addition, the axons of
the granule cells in the diseased tissue have been observed to sprout
recurrent fibers back to the proximal dendritic layers of the granule
cells.2 A comparison of the results of the experimental measurements
with the analysis of numerical multi-compartmental models
incorporating the electrophysiological properties of these abnormal
cells indicates a possible mechanism by which the enhanced NMDA
mediated conductance and the axonal feed-back can lead to the observed
hyperexcitability of these cells that may be responsible for epileptic
activity.

A Method for Estimating the Neural Input to a Neuron
using the Ionic Current Model

The ionic current properties of a neuron play a key role in
information processing in neural systems.  These ionic currents can be
described mathematically similar to Hodgkin-Huxley equations based on
voltage clamp experiments.  Such an ionic current model provides a
basis for understanding the neuronal function and for calculating the
individual ionic currents from experimentally recorded voltage
responses.  Here, we propose a method to estimate the total input
current to the neuron which produces the voltage response by using the
model. We first applied the method to Hodgkin-Huxley model and
confirmed that the input current is estimated correctly. Secondly, we
applied the method to retinal horizontal cell response and analyzed
the estimated total input current for the voltage responses with
various light stimuli.  Finally we discussed the role of individual
ionic current in the horizontal cell membrane and the underlying
mechanisms of the nonlinear dynamical voltage response.

Dissipative Structures and Self-Organizing Criticality in
Neural Networks with Spatially Localized Connections.

Internet: robert.kentridge@durham.ac.uk

Neural networks with asymmetric random connections may converge to
simple attractors or they may behave chaotically. If, however, the
probability of neu- ral interconnection in a network is related to the
distance between neurons, as it is in the brain, then a third class of
behavior (which could be used in coding representation), dissipative
structure formation, becomes possible. Simulations of such networks
showed that dissipative structures could form, however, this required
biologically implausible fine-tuning of the networks' parameters.
Further studies showed that conditions in which dissipative structure
formation was likely could be produced by uniform low intensity
stimulation of these networks through a process of self-organizing
criticality. This mechanism eliminates the requirement for bio-
logically implausible fine-tuning of networks thereby increasing the
probability that dissipative structures may play a functional role in
processing information in the brain.

Deterministic Entropy Measures
for Investigating Complex SpatioTemporal Order in Multi-Unit Spike
Train Data

Division of Neuroscience, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor
Plaza, Houston, TX 77030

Abstract

We consider the hypothesis that within a neural population, the
distribution of cell firing times is chaotic, characterized by a
finite Kolmogorov entropy. We contrast this with the alternative rate
code hypothesis, which asserts that the distribution of cell firing
times is ergodic, possessing an infinite Kolmogorov entropy. Starting
from an explicit expression for the entropy of a train of uncorrelated
events, characteristic features for the entropy of any ergodic process
are inferred. Entropy growth that is slower than logarithmic at
increased temporal resolutions, as well as anomalous renormalization
flow, is argued to be a sufficient indicator of an underlying chaotic
order. Stereotypical results are illustrated through the analysis of
computer generated spike train data. A parallel algorithm for
extracting the spike train entropy is provided.

The lateral eye of Limulus provides an unique opportunity to investigate
retinal function and the neural code of vision.  We have integrated
computational, physiological, and behavioral experimental methods to
investigate the information the eye sends to the brain and the efferent
modulation of the eye by the brain.  We developed a cell-based
computational model of the eye on a parallel computer (Connection
Machine).  The model structure is related closely to the anatomical
structure of the eye and the parameters are estimated from experimental
data.  Model computations are combined with behavioral data to
investigate the neural representation of the animal's visual world.

Assembly Formation and Segregation by a Self-organizing Neuronal Oscillator
Model

Max-Planck-Institut fur Hirnforschung
Deutschordenstrasse 46, 6000 Frankfurt 71, FRG

Abstract

Experimental evidence demonstrates the stimulus-dependent formation
and segregation of neuronal assemblies defined by coherent oscillatory
response patterns. In this paper, we investigate whether the
self-organization of synchronizing and desynchronizing connections can
establish a corresponding temporal response structure using local
learning rules. Motivated by recent experimental observations,
synchronizing connections are modified according to a two-threshold
Hebb-like learning rule, while we generalize this rule to analogous
Anti-Hebb-like weight changes for the desynchronizing connections. We
show that the resulting network exhibits synchronization and
segregation of oscillatory activity in agreement with the experiment.

Absence of Learning in Hyperacuity

Abstract--
        Human observers with previous experience in
psychophysical methods were tested on 34 different non-
stereo and 33 stereo hyperacuity tasks.  None of the observers
had any previous experience with non-stereo hyperacuity task.
The preliminary results showed no learning for the non-stereo
tasks.  The initial performancesQdefined by pooling the first
five responses for each of the 34 stimuliQwere well within
hyperacuity range.  All observers had experience in stereo
discrimination; their pooled initial five to ten responses
indicated no initial practice effects for stereo discrimination in
the fixation plane, but quite a rapid learning rate for stereo
discrimination 5' off the fixation plane.  Mechanisms of visual
hyperacuity do not appear to require learning or other
processes to improve performance with practice.

Using simple neural models, we have been studying how

parameters are studied by exhaustive search or genetic

neuron-two muscle system can generate rhythmic behavior that
can result in a net gain of energy.  2) In the absence of
modulatory inputs, the efficiency of the system sharply
degrades when individual parameters are varied only a small
percentage from those used to evolve the system.  It is
postulated that various forms of circuit modulation will
improve the functioning of the system over a wide range of

A MODEL FOR SELF-REGULATION OF NEURONAL ACIIVITY

Brandeis University Waltham, MA 02254.


We constructed a conductance-based model from biophysical data of a
stomatogastric ganglion neuron. Using this model, we address the question of
stability of neuronal activity despite changes in both the internal and
external environment. We propose that calcium could act as a regulatory
signal to adjust the ratio of conductances expressed by a neuron. We show
that the internal calcium concentration is highly correlated with electrical
properties and we build a feedback mechanism to link calcium to the maximal
conductance of each current. Models with dynamical maximal conductances can
self-assemble the currents they need to produce a given target activity
pattern from an arbitrary initial state and can recover from drastic changes
in extracellular ionic concentration. This mechanism allows increased
robustness and activity-dependent stabilization of network function.

Understanding the Functional Goals of Retinal Ganglion Cells

Zhaoping Li
School of Natural Science, Institute for Advanced Study
Princeton, NJ 08540, USA

Abstract


In mammalian retina, the Y (or M) ganglion cells are significantly
more transient in response, more selective to stimuli of low spatial
and high temporal frequencies, and less selective to spectral
information than the X (or P) cells. It is shown that these
differences in cell properties can be explained by a model that
assigns different functional goals to the different ganglion cell
types. In this model, the goal of the Y cells is to extract as fast as
possible the minimum amount of information necessary for quick
responses. In contrast, the goal of the X cells is to extract as much
information as possible. Temporal characteristics of the information
extraction by the two cell groups are also derived.

Acetylcholine appears to regulate the oscillatory properties of
cortical structures. Application of cholinergic agonists induces theta
rhythm oscilla- tory patterns in the piriform (olfactory) cortex
(Biedenbach, 1966) and the hippocampus (Konopacki et al., 1987). These
effects appear due to alter- ation of the intrinsic oscillatory
characteristics of cortical structures. In a simulation of the
oscillatory dynamics of piriform cortex (Liljenstrom, 1991), we show
that the neuromodulatory effects of acetylcholine can induce theta
rhythm oscillatory characteristics. The cholinergic increase in
excitability causes increased oscillatory activity while the
cholinergic suppression of ex- citatory intrinsic synaptic
transmission prevents gamma rhythm oscillatory dynamics from
predominating.

Abstract

An original model of the specialist olfactory system of insects, built
in a semi-random fashion constrained by biological data is presented.
A classification of the response patterns of individual neurons, based
on the temporal aspects of the observed response, allows to analyze
the behavior of the model with respect to he qualitative and the
temporal variations of the stimulus. Among the results, a number are
related to data about olfactory information processing reported in the
literature, others may serve as guidelines for further investigations.
We show how the model computes the information relevant as a basis for
further processing in higher centers.

ABSTRACT Parameters in network models can be adjusted using algorithms
that optimize the fit between the response of neurons in the model and
biological system. Often, however, more is known about behavior than
neuronal responses. Using chemotaxis in the nematode C. elegans as a
model system, we adapted a recurrent backpropagation algorithm to
optimize parameters using behavioral data alone. In this form,
backpropagation successfully optimized a dynamical network to chemotax
in a simple environment. This sets the stage for the use of
optimization techniques in more realistic models of the anatomically
well-defined nervous system of C. elegans.

Abstract: Thalamocortical relay cells show a rich repertoire
of oscillatory behaviors depending on membrane voltage: 1-
3 Hz slow wave oscillations, 8-10 Hz spindle oscillations and
100 Hz repetitive spiking. We have looked at the intrinsic
dynamics of a model relay cell with realistic geometry and 9
voltage-sensitive channels. Spindling and slow wave oscillation
could be reproduced in the model but were just two points
along a spectrum of oscillation rate that varied with degree of
hyperpolarization. Simulated cortical stimulation was effective
ln phase resetting of either rhythm and could entrain the slower
rhythm to higher frequencies.

Abstract

This work addresses the question whether information encoded in the
neuronal firing frequency can be transformed into spatial encoding. If
neurons with a broad spectrum of membrane time constants (MTC) exist,
or a precisely wired circuitry incorporating delay lines is assumed, a
frequency-spatial transformation (FST) is clearly possible. However,
various cortical regions are composed of neurons with short MTCs,
which are randomly connected with each other. Introducing a stochastic
component into the neurons' dynamics, we present a FST scheme which
incorporates random connections and requires memory in a limited
sense. Our scheme is presented and analyzed for a feed-forward
network. We also discuss its applicability for a random network, and
present some supporting simulation results.

Large Nonlinear Pattern Discrimination in Dendritic Trees

A recent compartmental modeling study showed that a dendritic tree rich in
NMDA-type synaptic channels is selectively responsive to spatially
clustered, as opposed to diffuse, pattens of synaptic activation
\cite{mel:neuralcomp}.  This ``cluster-sensitivity'' property was shown to
be a sufficient mechanism to underlie true nonlinear pattern discrimination
at the single cell level.  The effects of other
physiologically-characterized nonlinear membrane mechanisms have now been
tested with respect to dendritic cluster-sensitivity, including
voltage-dependent sodium and calcium channels of various kinetics and in
various spatial distributions.  Under loose assumptions, the capacity for
nonlinear pattern discrimination can be greatly enhanced by the presence of
excitatory voltage-dependent membrane channels.  An abstract model neuron,
called a {\sl clusteron}, is shown to capture important aspects of the
cluster-sensitive input-output behavior of a full biophysically-modeled
dendritic tree.  An analysis of the storage capacity of the {\sl clusteron}
is presented, and empirical results with a cluster-sensitive Hebb-type
learning rule are shown to lead to a large storage capacity for
nonlinearly-separable pattern sets.

Adaptive Receptive Fields for Textural
Sgmentation


Edmond Mesrobian and Josef Skrzypek
Machine Perception Laboratory
Computer Science Department
University of California
Los Angeles, CA 90024



Abstract

Textural segmentation plays an important role in the figure-ground
discrimination process. Many current models of mechanisms underlying
textural segmentation assume that texture "contrast" information,
captured at the border of two abutting textured regions, is sufficient
to reconstruct the original surfaces of the textures. These approaches
are based on the additional assumption that center-surround receptive
fields of visual neurons are perfectly balanced; a uniform stimulus
pattern, covering both the center and the surround, produces a zero
response. We argue that such models would produce incorrect
reconstructions of textural surfaces, and describe a neural network
architecture for textural segmentation that can adaptively delimit the
boundaries of uniformly textured regions. Simulation results are
presented to demonstrate the segmentation capabilities of the
architecture.

        ABSTRACT

        We have developed a detailed description of voltage
dependent ion channels to model the currents involved in spike
generation in complex neuron models. The model consists of a
reduced Hodgkin-Huxley formalism with added noise and shunting
terms. Phase plane analysis was introduced to study the behavior of
this model under various parameter settings. We used this model to
reproduce the spike shape and spiking statistics of one particular type
of interneuron in the cricket cercal sensory system, for which a large
amount of electrophysiological and morphological data is available.

Effect of input synchrony on the response of a model neuron

Dept. of Physiology & Biophysics, SJ-40, University of Washington, Seattle, Wa 98195


ABSTRACT: We studied the dependence of the average spike frequency
(f-out) of a biophysically realistic model neuron on the degree of
synchrony (s, varied from 0 to 100%) in its excitatory synaptic
inputs. The following independent parameters were systematically
varied: (1) N, the number of inputs to the neuron, (2) f-in, the
average frequency of the inputs, and (3) w, the strength of the input
connection. The goal was to empirically determine the relation: f-out
= F(N, fin, w, s). The results indicate that for parameter values in
the range found in neocortical cells, input synchrony can affect
output significantly.

The dimension reduction from the multi-dimensional feature space to
the two-dimensional cortical plane is realized by complex maps which
so far have evaded intuitive understanding. We show that the most
salient features of these maps can be understood from a few basic
design principles: local correlation, isotropy and homogeneity. We
define these principles in a mathematically exact sense and we show
that they are sufficient to generate realistic column structures. We
suggest that the reason why most of the previously proposed models of
orientation columns are capable of generating realistically looking
orientation column structures is simply that any model which is
consistent with the aforementioned principles is capable of doing so.

ABSTRACT A model is presented to investigate the role of the feedback
in the development of ocular dominance columns (ODC's) in V1. In the
model, the the subplate locally integrates the activity of cortical
layer IV is feeds it back to the same. Anatomical evidence indicates
that this is possible. Modification of geniculocortical synaptic
strengths is accomplished by the Alopex algorithm, which utilizes
temporal correlations between changes in the feedback activity and
changes in geniculocortical input activity. Alopex could be
implemented by geniculocortical NMDA receptors in conjunction with
subplate feedback. Computer simulations of the model resulted in
robust formation of ODC's.

In the cochlea of the cat and other mammals each afferent auditory
neuron receives all its input from a single synapse on its target
inner hair cell.  The randomness and plasticity of synaptic
transmission therefore profoundly influence the encoding of sound by
action potentials in the auditory nerve.  We present a mathematical
model of continuous signal transmission by a synapse that can account
for the observed history dependence and statistics of auditory nerve
firing.  The operation of a synapse is described in terms of
interacting stochastic processes - stimulus driven vesicle exocytosis,
vesicle recirculation, and postsynaptic potential generation.

Abstract

     We have developed a simulation system, based on realistic
representations of neurons, which exploits massive parallelism to represent
the processing performed by the first few levels of the generalized
mammalian auditory system.  We have modeled the cochlea, auditory nerve
(AN), anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) and medial superior olivary
nucleus (MSO).  These structures produce a variety of maps of auditory
space which are used by further processing centers to extract the cues used
in auditory perception.  The centers we have modeled thus far play a role
in binaural signal processing.

Switching Between Predictable and Unpredictable States

Abstract

Visual inspection of data from cat visual cortex reveals, that the
recently discovered 40-Hz-oscillations do not consist of a permanent
oscillatory signal during the whole period of stimulation, but instead
display interchanging stochastic and regular phases, both of varying
duration times. In order to base this observation on firm statistical
grounds, we assume that the signal should be predictable during
regular epochs, unpredictable during the irregular epochs. Employing
the method of time-resolved mutual information, first we calculate the
time-resolved predictability within the LFP-signal from a single
electrode. Periods of high temporal coherence can clearly be
discrminated from periods of stochastic behaviour. The analysis of the
spatial coherence with the same method yields, that synchronous
activity between two electrodes is largely restricted to episodes of
high temporal coherence.

A most important basic research goal of neurocomputing is to identify,
from biological neural nets, the mathematics intrinsic to neural net
function. From up to ten cerebellar Purkinje cells of locomotory cats,
multi-electrode recordings were obtained and the geometry of the
functional manifold was calculated. The covariant metric tensor was
calculated by cross-correlation analysis and the contravariant metric
tensor was obtained by its Moore-Penrose inverse. For adequate
analysis of massively parallel data, a transputer-based neurocomputer
was built. Results demonstrate the non-Euclidean neural geometry and
its modifiability with learning. Identification of geometry permits
decoding, of external invariants (distances) from neural firings.

The  Gating Lattice is proposed as a basic neural building block
for dynamic gating of patterns between cortical areas.  Dynamic gating
involves the selection of contiguous patterns from an input stage,
which are then routed via one or more intermediate stages towards an
output stage.  A Gating Lattice consists of many distributed processors
whose local interactions ensure appropriate selection, and whose global
behavior can be described in terms of statistical mechanics.  Combined
with a modification of the shifter-circuit architecture (Anderson and
Van Essen, 1987) it represents a model for attentional selection in the
occipitotemporal pathway.

A Neural Model of Illusory Contour Perception

Abstract

Illusory contours, which are perceived in absence of luminance
contrast data, play an important role in visual processing. However,
it is not clear what kind and how much information is necessary for
the perception of this phenomenon. Most of the available explanations
assume that contrast information on both sides of a gap is sufflcient
to complete an illusory contour. Using a computer simulation we
evaluated hypothesized explanation by making explicit physiological
and psychophysical constraints. Our results indicate that a solution
to illusory contour perception may lie with a recurrent network which
integrates information about illusory surfaces (brightness and
binocularity) with available contour information (luminance contrast).

Temporal Structure can solve the Binding Problem for Multiple Feature Domains

   Max-Planck-Institut fur Hirnforschung

Abstract

We investigate a solution to the binding problem in visual processing
using temporal structure in a neuronal network. First, we demonstrate
binding and segregation of assemblies by synchronizing and
desynchronizing connections for a single feature representation. Then,
we extend this model to multiple feature domains where each member of
an distributed assembly is specific for its single particular feature
expression only. This avoids the combinatorial explosion of
multispecific cardinal cells. Besides binding by synchronization of
temporal structure of distributed neuronal responses, our simulations
demonstrate also for these examples that synchronization has to be
complemented by a means for stimulus-dependent desynchronization.

Computer models were constructed for neurons recorded in vitro in the
cardiovascular NTS of the rat. These neurons showed time- and
voltage-dependent spike discharge patterns and subthreshold voltage
trajectories when they were intracellularly injected with constant
current pulses. Models of membrane ion channels were constructed and
used to produce and match this dynamic behav- ior. Network models
composed of these neurons and reflecting baroreceptor reflex
organization in the NTS were used to explore systems level computation
within the reflex. Highly non-linear and unpredicted activity was
observed in simulations. However, some of these simulation results
were taken as hyptheses and have subsequently been observed
experimentally anatomically and in vivo.

Hagai Agmon-Snir and Idan Segev, Dept. Neurobiol. Inst. Life Sciences,
Hebrew Univ. Jerusalem, 91904, Israel.

    Neurons behave like delay lines.  A significant delay is contributed by
the cable properties of the dendrites as synaptic potentials propagate from
their sites of origin towards the spike initiation zone.  We introduce a
novel analytical approach for calculating signal delay in arbitrary passive
structures.  Dendritic delay is defined as the difference between the center
of gravity (the centroid) of the transient current input and the center of
gravity of the resultant voltage transient, measured at any point in the
dendritic tree.  Several general theorems on the effect of various
biophysical and geometrical parameters on the delay are proven.  Specific
examples for the delay in different geometries, ranging from an isopotential
soma to complicated trees, are given.  We discuss the implications of the
results for the computations that may be performed by nerve cells.

Unsupervised Hebbian Learning and the Shape of the Neuron Activation Function

A model describing unsupervised Hebbian learning in a single neuron is
presented. The dynamical equations are solved directly in a few simple
cases, methods of statistical mechanics are used to compute the
probability distribution for the stationary solutions for random
patterns, and simulations are presented. The processing function which
the neuron learns is strongly dependent on the shape of the activation
function. When the activation function is linear, the neuron learns to
compute a statistical property of the collection of input patterns.
When it is sufficiently nonlinear, the neuron forms a grandmother cell
representation of one of the patterns.

Abstract

Recent anatomical and physiological results suggest that luminance
contrast adaptation in the primate retina is localized to synaptic
interactions of the outer plexiform layer(OPL). We present a
quantitative study of luminance contrast adaptation using a computer
model of the primate OPL derived from known anatomy and physiology.
Results demonstrate that simple network interactions can implement
invariant contrast adaptation while maintaining high luminance
contrast sensitivity over 7 log units of retinal illuminance.
Furthermore, simulation results predict behavior consistent with known
psychophysics of primate foveal photopic vision. As far as we know
this is the first quantitative demonstration of compatibility of
primate OPL anatomy, physiology and psychophysics.

Abstract

We have constructed a model of a thalamic relay cell based on voltage
clamp data obtained in thalamic slices and isolated relay cells. This
model replicates most, but not all, of the behavior found in
current-clamp recordings from these cells. Analysis of the model
provides insight into the role of the various voltage-dependent
conductances in the response of these cells to current injection and
synaptic input. Additionally, the model provides insight into the
insufficiency of traditional methods of measuring passive parameters,
and may provide a tool for better understanding of voltage-clamp
results.

ABSTRACT

Psychophysical studies suggest that humans perceive moving sine plaids
as fused when the underlying component gratings are of sufficiently
different speed, orientation, and contrast (Adelson & Movshon 1982;
Welch, 1990). Other experiments indicate that for short presentation
times, the velocities of fused type II sine plaids are not always
consistent with the intersection of constraints. We propose a gradient
inhibition model that explains these phenomena using only local
intensity information. Computational results show a contrast dependent
transition for splitting/fusion of sine plaid images. This model
suggests that transparency information can be locally computed and
subsequently fed into global vision modules.

Cortical Cells Should Fire Regularly, But Do Not

William R. Softky & Christof Koch
216-76 California Institute of Technology
Pasadena, CA 91125


Abstract

The standard theory of a leaky integrator with stochastic spike input
predicts that cortical cells should fire regularly. We tested
interspike-interval histograms from awake, behaving macaque visual
cortex (Vl and MT), and found high levels of variability (CV > 0.5)
characteristic of a nearly random (Poisson) process. A simple
integrate-and-fire model, using accepted biophysical parameters, fails
by more than a factor of ten to account for the high CV. We also
simulated a biophysically detailed compartment-model of an
anatomically reconstructed and physiologically characterized layer V
pyramidal cell; again, at high firing rate, CV values are low, in
disagreement with the data. Only a few situations could account for
this discrepency: very large EPSP's, a very short membrane time
constant (Tm < 0.3 msec), or highly correlated (e.g. synchronized)
input. Our analysis suggests that cortical computation may occur at a
time-scale much faster than previously realized.

The effects of random fluctuations of single ion channels upon
transmembrane voltage dynamics are investigated with the example of
the giant axon of the squid Loligo.  A simulation using the
continuous, deterministic Hodgkin-Huxley equations is compared to a
simulation using discrete, stochastic ion channel populations modeled
as Markov processes.  The relative convergence and divergence of the
membrane behavior predicted by the two alternative simulations is
compared.  It is demonstrated that random microscopic behavior, such
as single channel fluctuations,can producerandom macrosopic behavior,
such as action potentials, under many common biophysical conditions.
The various parameters contributing to the amplification of this
channel noise are analyzed and estimates for the noise sensitivity of
a given membrane are derived.  Many interesting biological adaptations
have evolved to either exploit or suppress thischannel noise.  These
biological regimes are surveyed and their computational significance
is considered.

A Model of Direction Selectivity in Visual Cortex Using

 Almost all models of orientation and direction-selectivity in visual
 cortex are based on feed-forward  connection schemes, where
 geniculate input provides all excitation to both pyramidal and
 inhibitory neurons. The latter neurons then veto the response of the
 former for non-optimal stimuli.  However,  the majority of the synaptic input
 on any cortical cell is provided by other cortical cells. Based on the
 canonical microcircuit of Douglas \& Martin (1991), we
 simulate here this massive excitatory and inhibitory synaptic convergence
 in order to explain a number of puzzling features about direction
 selective simple cells.  In this model, weak geniculate input is
 dramatically amplified by the action of intracortical excitation, while
 inhibition has a dual role: (i) to prevent the early geniculate-induced
 excitation in the null direction  and (ii)  to serve as gain-control
 element.

Structure-Function correlations in nucleus laminaris.

Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
and
Program in Neuroscience

Princeton, NJ 08544

Abstract

Computer simulations designed to study horizontal sound localization
suggest that morphological differences between homologous neurons in
barn owls and other birds are related to the range of frequencies
employed and to the biophysical algorithm used for "coincidence
detection". Barn owls measure interaural phase differences from 3 - 9
kHz. The cells performing this function are a-dendritic and receive
many synapses from each side. In simulation, coherent phase-locked
inputs produce a synaptic modulation at the stimulus frequency that is
proportional to interaural phase difference, being absent for
out-of-phase binaural inputs. Spike generators selective for rapid
voltage modulations can thus be used for coincidence detection.
Modifications of the Hodgkin-Huxley model were found that enable such
selectivity. In contrast, chickens use lower frequencies and have
coincidence detectors with long bipolar dendrites and long, thin axon
initial segments. These can provide greater temporal discrimination at
the expense of high frequency responsiveness. High and low frequency
coincidence detection may therefore be achieved by different
anatomical and biophysical means.

Abstract

A novel vectorial statistic is introduced to detect temporally
correlated firing patterns in a network of n neurons. A
"cross-interval" vector is used to establish the temporal relationship
of cross-intervals between firings in neurons. The resultant vectorial
sum of these vectors provides a statistical measure of an n-tuple
correlation among all n neurons in the network in contrast to the
pair-wise correlation limitation in cross-correlation analysis. The
normalized resultant vectors not only capture and reduce an O(n3)
combinatorial correlation to an O(n) vectorial statistic but also
provide quantitative descriptions of dynamical interactions from the
trajectories and clusters of these vectors in the phase-plane. It
provides another unique technique to analyze the interactions among
multiple processes in a nonlinear dynamical system.

Representation of sensory information in the cricket cercal sensory system:
an information theoretic analysis.

Biology. University of California, Berkeley. CA 94720.

Abstract.
        The activity patterns of primary sensory interneurons in the
cricket cercal sensory system encode information about the direction and
velocity of air current stimuli in the animal's immediate environment.
The statistical principles of information theory were used to calculate the
maximum directional accuracy attainable from the response ensemble of
8 interneurons in this system. These calculations of encoding accuracy
took into account the temporal patterns of the spike train patterns, and a
canonical discriminant analysis was used to reduce the number of
dimensions of the response to a few significant ones. The response of the
system in the canonical coordinates could be fitted by sine functions of
360 and 180 degree periods.

 Electrophysiological dissection of the three excitatory
 inputs to cerebellar Purkinje cells
 
 John H. Thompson and James M. Bower
 
 	Experiments in our and other laboratories have described the
spatial organization of tactile mossy fiber projections to the granule
cell layer of crus IIa of rat cerebellar cortex.  Using high density
micro-mapping techniques, it has been shown that the perioral regions
are represented by a fractured somatotopic map. That is, there are
patches within whose boundaries a region of the rat's face is
somatotopically mapped. At patch boundaries, however, there are
discontinuities after which a new, not necessarily peripherally
adjoining region is mapped. The granule cells which receive these
inputs project to the molecular layer which contains the dendrites of
the Purkinje cells. In this layer the granule cell axons bifurcate
forming the parallel fibers which run parallel to each other for
several millimeters across patch boundaries contacting numerous
Purkinje cells along their length. Bower and Woolston (1983) found
that the shortest latency tactile projections to the Purkinje cells in
this region were spatially congruent to those in the granule cell
layer. That is, activated Purkinje cells were directly over activated
granule cells. This suggested that the ascending portion of the
granule cell axon (which synapses on Purkinje cells on the way up) was
responsible for this short latency response.

 	In these experiments we record from a Purkinje cell while
stimulating perioral regions projecting to the underlying granule
cells, constructing a peri-stimulus time histogram (PST) from the
spikes recorded from 300 trials. Then, the stimulus is moved to other
regions which project to patches in the same folium but removed from
the Purkinje cell.  In separate trials, both regions which send
parallel fibers to the Purkinje cell and some which don't are
stimulated. Comparing the PSTs from the various trials, we conclude
that the short latency excitatory response is mediated by the input
from the ascending portion of the granule cell axon only. There is a
prolonged, longer latency response starting approximately 40 ms after
the stimulus and lasting for 100 to 400 ms which is mediated by the
parallel fibers. There is little or no response to stimuli in regions
not connected by the parallel fibers. Lastly, we are able to
discriminate between the simple spikes in Purkinje cells generated by
the two granule cell inputs and the complex spikes generated by the
other input pathway, the climbing fibers from the inferior olive. We
have not been able to statistically link the climbing fiber pathway to
the generation of either the short or long latency responses.

 	The results of these experiments are studied in the context of
a new interpretation of the functional significance of cerebellar
cortical architecture. Purkinje cells respond to specific information
relayed via the ascending branch in the context of more subtle
modulation provided by the parallel fibers. This allows a new
understanding of the fractured somatotopic organization of mossy fiber
projections.

Auditory System

Abstract


A literal computational model of the cat subcortical auditory system,
from the cochlea to the medial geniculate body of the thalamus is
described. The model includes subunits representing the basilar
membrane/hair cell system of the cochlea, parts of the cochlear
nucleus, the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus and the
ventral division of the medial geniculate body in the thalamus. Each
subunit consists of model neurons whose structure, dynamics and
connectivity are based as much as possible on what is known of the cat
auditory system. The goal of this modeling effort is to shed light on
the role of (1) the convergent/divergent projections seen between each
stage of the auditory system and (2) the efferent projections sent
from higher stages to lower.

Abstract

A novel analytical approach is presented, which allows studying the
dynamics of reciprocally connected networks of integrate-and-fire
model neurons. Synaptic interactions are modelled at the level of
conductance changes, and firing rate adaptation is induced by a
spike-activated intrinsic potassium conductance. One obtains both the
attractor states of the network and the full spectrum of time
constants of the transients leading to those attractor states. Using
parameters appropriate to neocortical pyramidal cells, one can
estimate, from the slowest transients, the time required for lateral
processing, and compare with new experimental data on the time course
of single-cell responses in behaving primates.

ANALYSIS OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF GENICULATE AFFERENTS UPON PYRAMIDAL
NEURONS IN TURTLE VISUAL CORTEX. P. S. Ulinski and L. J. Larson-Prior,
Department of Organismal Biology and Anatomy, University of Chicago,
Chicago, IL 60637.

Pyramidal neurons in the lateral visual cortex receive geniculate
afferents upon their proximal dendrites, while those in the medial
part receive geniculate afferents upon their distal dendrites.
Geniculate EPSPs recorded in vitro from the somata of lateral
pyramidal neurons consist of 2-3 unitary EPSPs distributed over a time
window of 25 msec while medially located pyramidal neurons exhibit 5
or more unitary EPSPs over 100 msec The very different waveforms
generated in lateral versus medial pyramidal neurons can be understood
by the differences in the distribution of geniculate afferents upon
their dendritic arbors. Supported by PHS Grant EY 68352

ABSTRACT

We have demonstrated that bath-applied norepinephrine in doses ranging
from 10 - 50 uM can cause a long-lasting increase in the strength of
intrinsic excitatory synaptic evoked potentials, which may imply that
it is serving as a "learning switch" to increase plasticity during
behaviorally relevant situations. Norepinephrine treatment initially
causes a rapid and dose-dependent suppression of synaptic transmission
at excitatory intrinsic fiber synapses in rat piriform cortex, similar
to but weaker than the response to the acetylcholine agonist carbachol
reported in an earlier study (Hasselmo and Bower 1991). Unlike
carbachol, in roughly half the cases investigated large increases in
excitatory evoked potentials occurred upon withdrawal of
norepinephrine from the medium, without using tetanizing stimuli. We
are incorporating these findings into our realistic models of
associative memory function in piriform cortex.

In this paper we investigate the simulation of neural networks on
distributed-memory, message-passing multiprocessor systems,
by means of a CSP-like language and its own programming environment
designed and implemented at the Universita di
Napoli. Many interesting features make this language suitable
for simulation and fast prototyping of neural network models.
Among them there are generality, modularity and ease of use.
In addition, its implementation on distributed systems
allows the development of scalable and portable applications
and assures a very promising level of efficiency.

In vertebrates like eel and lamprey a laterally directed wave is prop-
agated down the body, pushing the animal forwards through the water.
Whereas the function of the segmental neuronal network underlying locomo-
tion (lamprey) is understood, the intersegmental coordination has remained
enigmatic. Each spinal segment is connected by excitatory interneurons from
neighbouring segments. Our model (7 to 20 segments) of this experimentally
established network generates intersegmental coordination. Furthermore the
phase lag can be graded and made to change sign, (enabling forward and
backward swimming), by adding extra excitation only to one segment in the
rostral or caudal part of the oscillator chain.

Abstract

We present a neural model for the organization and neural dynamics of
the medial pallium, the toad's homolog of mammalian hippocampus. A
neural mechanism, called cumulative shrinking, is proposed for mapping
temporal responses into a form of population coding referenced by
spatial positions. Synaptic plasticity is modeled as an interaction of
two dynamic processes which simulates both short-term and long-term
memory. Successful modeling allows us to provide an account of the
neural mechanisms of stimulus specific habituation. A set of model
predictions is presented, conceming mechanisms of habituation and
cellular organization of the medial pallium.

Synchronization Among Inhibitory Model Neurons:
Interplay Between Rebound Excitation and Synaptic Kinetics

It is well known that mutual inhibition in a neuronal network can lead
to alternating rhythmic patterns of electrical activity.  Here, in
contrast, we show with a theoretical model that mutually inhibitory
cells, capable of post-inhibitory rebound, can be synchronized to zero
phase difference, provided that synaptic activation decays slowly
enough to outlast the presynaptic excitation.  This study is motivated
by consideration of a hypothesis on synchronizing mechanisms for the
thalamocortical 10 Hz spindle rhythms, that the reticular thalamic
nucleus (RTN) plays a role of pacemaker or synchronizer of spindles in
the thalamus.  Our results suggest that synchronization among
GABAergic RTN cells can be mediated by GABA-B postsynaptic receptors
which possess the required kinetic properties.

The recent neurophysiological experiments revealed that the spatial
synchronization of neural activity across a population of oscillatory
neurons exist in the sensory systems.  A discrete-time model of
coupled limit-cycle and chaotic neural network oscillators is
constructed to investigate the coupling structures of the oscillators
that are capable of generating the synchronization in neural activity
similar to that observed in the experiments.Simulations on the
responses of one- and two-dimensional coupled limit-cycle oscillators
to two short bar stimuli of varying gap distance and on the phase
transitions of coexisting chaotic attractors of coupled chaotic
oscillators to different coded inputs are performed.

                              ABSTRACT

      Carver Mead has pioneered the use of analog VLSI for building
      silicon systems based on neurobiological principles.  As the
      computational and communication benefits of spiking neurons become
      more appreciated, there is a growing interest in increasingly
      realistic "silicon neuron" circuits.

      Many groups are developing silicon synapses, which, combined with
      the silicon neurons, will allow the creation of large biologically
      realistic networks of spiking neurons on a single piece of silicon.
      As these networks become more and more sophisticated, there will be
      a need for simulation tools that are appropriate for the circuit
      primitives.

      This paper describes simple but realistic silicon neurons, synapses,
      and a fast event-driven simulator optimized for networks of these
      analog silicon neurons and synapses.  The silicon neuron and synapse
      circuits have been fabricated and successfully tested, both individually
      and in small networks.  Examples are presented from working chips
      and compared to results from the simulator.

ENTRAINMENT OF THE LAMPREY LOCOMOTOR CPG: ANALYSIS AND SIMULATION

Thelma L. Williams Physiology Department, St.George's Hospital Medical
School, London SW17 ORE, U.K.


Entrainment of a chain of neural oscillators by an external oscillator
coupled at one end has been simulated, using connectionist networks.
The unit oscillator of the chain consists of synaptically coupled
cells postulated to form the basis of the central pattern generator
for locomotion in the lamprey. The frequency range over which
one-to-one entrainment occurs has been determined for different forms
of intersegmental coupling. The dependence of this entrainment range
on the characteristics of coupling, and the effect of entrainment on
intersegmental phase lags have been investigated and compared with the
predictions of mathematical analysis of oscillator chains.

Field Discontinuities and Islands in Visual Cortical Maps
as a Self-Organized Phenomenon

Abstract

We present an explanation for the formation of field discontinuities
(FDs) in the visual cortical maps of various mammals. Simulating
retinocortical map formation with selforganizing feature maps (SFMs),
we find a critical influence of the geometry of target area boundaries
on the global structure of the map. One or more FDs are formed as the
elongation of the cortical area increases. This is in good agreement
with the general observation that second order transformations of the
visual field are found in elongated areas only. The observation of
islands in the visual field representation of cat A18/19 is explained
by the occurrence of more than one FD. Generally the maps show a local
increase of the areal magnification factor near the origin of the FD.
This prediction might be accessible to future experiments.

Spatial and temporal integration by locust nonspiking
interneurons:  Voltage-dependent electrical geometry.
Haiyun Zhang and Gilles Laurent,  California Institute of
Technology,  Biology Division,  CNS Program, 139-74,  Pasadena,
CA 91125.

We constructed a simplified computer model of a locust nonspiking
interneuron, using morphological features from intracellular cobalt
and HRP fills, and biophysical parameters determined from
voltage-clamp studies.  The model has 56 compartments, a leak and 2
voltage-activated K conductances with different kinetics of activation
and inactivation.  These active conductances are known from
current-clamp experiments to lead to a ten-fold change in membrane
time constant over the normal operating range of the interneurons.  We
ran numerical simulation experiments to study the changes in apparent
space constant with membrane voltage.  We found that the electrical
geometry of a nonspiking interneuron can be dramatically altered by
small changes in membrane voltage, leading to compartmentalization at
the more positive potentials.
