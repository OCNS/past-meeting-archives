The functional organization of a sensory map in a simple insect sensory system was studied using a combination of anatomical and electrophysiological techniques. Analysis of the map indicates that air current direction is represented in a continuous fashion within the map. Directionally selective primary sensory interneurons extract directional information from the map by virtue of the position of their dendritic arbors within the map. To test this structure-function hypothesis we have modeled the directional tuning curves of primary sensory interneurons based on the anatomical relationships between the interneurons and the map. The predicted tuning curves are very similar to the experimentally observed curves.
