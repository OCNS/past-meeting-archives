      <p><b>Title:</b> A Neuronal Modeling System for Generating Brainstem Maps of Auditory Space</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> We have developed a simulation system, based on realistic representations of 
      neurons, which exploits massive parallelism to represent the processing performed by the first 
      few levels of the generalized mammalian auditory system. We have modeled the cochlea, auditory 
      nerve (AN), anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) and medial superior olivary nucleus (MSO). 
      These structures produce a variety of maps of auditory space which are used by further 
      processing centers to extract the cues used in auditory perception. The centers we have modeled 
      thus far play a role in binaural signal processing.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> Switching Between Predictable and Unpredictable States in Data from Cat Visual 
      Cortex</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Visual inspection of data from cat visual cortex reveals, that the
      recently discovered 40-Hz-oscillations do not consist of a permanent
      oscillatory signal during the whole period of stimulation, but instead
      display interchanging stochastic and regular phases, both of varying
      duration times. In order to base this observation on firm statistical
      grounds, we assume that the signal should be predictable during
      regular epochs, unpredictable during the irregular epochs. Employing
      the method of time-resolved mutual information, first we calculate the
      time-resolved predictability within the LFP-signal from a single
      electrode. Periods of high temporal coherence can clearly be
      discrminated from periods of stochastic behaviour. The analysis of the
      spatial coherence with the same method yields, that synchronous
      activity between two electrodes is largely restricted to episodes of
      high temporal coherence.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> Geometry Intrinsic to Population Responses of Cerebellar Purkinje Cells as 
      Revealed by Neurocomputer Analysis of Multi-Unit Recordings from Biological Neural Nets</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> A most important basic research goal of neurocomputing is to identify, from 
      biological neural nets, the mathematics intrinsic to neural net function. From up to ten 
      cerebellar Purkinje cells of locomotory cats, multi-electrode recordings were obtained and the 
      geometry of the functional manifold was calculated. The covariant metric tensor was calculated 
      by cross-correlation analysis and the contravariant metric tensor was obtained by its 
      Moore-Penrose inverse. For adequate analysis of massively parallel data, a transputer-based 
      neurocomputer was built. Results demonstrate the non-Euclidean neural geometry and its 
      modifiability with learning. Identification of geometry permits decoding, of external invariants 
      (distances) from neural firings.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> The Gating Lattice: A Neural Substrate for Dynamic Gating</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> The Gating Lattice is proposed as a basic neural building block for dynamic 
      gating of patterns between cortical areas. Dynamic gating involves the selection of contiguous 
      patterns from an input stage, which are then routed via one or more intermediate stages towards 
      an output stage. A Gating Lattice consists of many distributed processors whose local 
      interactions ensure appropriate selection, and whose global behavior can be described in terms 
      of statistical mechanics. Combined with a modification of the shifter-circuit architecture 
      (Anderson and Van Essen, 1987) it represents a model for attentional selection in the 
      occipitotemporal pathway.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> A Neural Model of Illusory Contour Perception</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Illusory contours, which are perceived in absence of luminance contrast data, 
      play an important role in visual processing. However, it is not clear what kind and how much 
      information is necessary for the perception of this phenomenon. Most of the available 
      explanations assume that contrast information on both sides of a gap is sufflcient to complete 
      an illusory contour. Using a computer simulation we evaluated hypothesized explanation by making 
      explicit physiological and psychophysical constraints. Our results indicate that a solution to 
      illusory contour perception may lie with a recurrent network which integrates information about 
      illusory surfaces (brightness and binocularity) with available contour information (luminance 
      contrast).</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> Temporal Structure can solve the Binding Problem for Multiple Feature Domains</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> We investigate a solution to the binding problem in visual processing using 
      temporal structure in a neuronal network. First, we demonstrate binding and segregation of 
      assemblies by synchronizing and desynchronizing connections for a single feature representation. 
      Then, we extend this model to multiple feature domains where each member of an distributed 
      assembly is specific for its single particular feature expression only. This avoids the 
      combinatorial explosion of multispecific cardinal cells. Besides binding by synchronization of 
      temporal structure of distributed neuronal responses, our simulations demonstrate also for these 
      examples that synchronization has to be complemented by a means for stimulus-dependent 
      desynchronization.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> Modeling neuronal dynamics predicts responses in the rat baroreflex</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Computer models were constructed for neurons recorded in vitro in the 
      cardiovascular NTS of the rat. These neurons showed time- and voltage-dependent spike discharge 
      patterns and subthreshold voltage trajectories when they were intracellularly injected with 
      constant current pulses. Models of membrane ion channels were constructed and used to produce 
      and match this dynamic behav- ior. Network models composed of these neurons and reflecting 
      baroreceptor reflex organization in the NTS were used to explore systems level computation 
      within the reflex. Highly non-linear and unpredicted activity was observed in simulations. 
      However, some of these simulation results were taken as hyptheses and have subsequently been 
      observed experimentally anatomically and in vivo.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> Dendritic delay</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Neurons behave like delay lines. A significant delay is contributed by the 
      cable properties of the dendrites as synaptic potentials propagate from their sites of origin 
      towards the spike initiation zone. We introduce a novel analytical approach for calculating 
      signal delay in arbitrary passive structures. Dendritic delay is defined as the difference 
      between the center of gravity (the centroid) of the transient current input and the center of 
      gravity of the resultant voltage transient, measured at any point in the dendritic tree. Several 
      general theorems on the effect of various biophysical and geometrical parameters on the delay 
      are proven. Specific examples for the delay in different geometries, ranging from an 
      isopotential soma to complicated trees, are given. We discuss the implications of the results 
      for the computations that may be performed by nerve cells.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> Unsupervised Hebbian Learning and the Shape of the Neuron Activation Function</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> A model describing unsupervised Hebbian learning in a single neuron is 
      presented. The dynamical equations are solved directly in a few simple cases, methods of 
      statistical mechanics are used to compute the probability distribution for the stationary 
      solutions for random patterns, and simulations are presented. The processing function which the 
      neuron learns is strongly dependent on the shape of the activation function. When the activation 
      function is linear, the neuron learns to compute a statistical property of the collection of 
      input patterns. When it is sufficiently nonlinear, the neuron forms a grandmother cell 
      representation of one of the patterns.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> Invariant Contrast Adaptation in the Outer Plexiform Layer of the Primate 
      Retina</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Recent anatomical and physiological results suggest that luminance contrast 
      adaptation in the primate retina is localized to synaptic interactions of the outer plexiform 
      layer(OPL). We present a quantitative study of luminance contrast adaptation using a computer 
      model of the primate OPL derived from known anatomy and physiology. Results demonstrate that 
      simple network interactions can implement invariant contrast adaptation while maintaining high 
      luminance contrast sensitivity over 7 log units of retinal illuminance. Furthermore, simulation 
      results predict behavior consistent with known psychophysics of primate foveal photopic vision. 
      As far as we know this is the first quantitative demonstration of compatibility of primate OPL 
      anatomy, physiology and psychophysics.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> A Model of a Thalamic Relay Cell Incorporating Voltage-Clamp Data on Ionic 
      Conductances</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> We have constructed a model of a thalamic relay cell based on voltage clamp 
      data obtained in thalamic slices and isolated relay cells. This model replicates most, but not 
      all, of the behavior found in current-clamp recordings from these cells. Analysis of the model 
      provides insight into the role of the various voltage-dependent conductances in the response of 
      these cells to current injection and synaptic input. Additionally, the model provides insight 
      into the insufficiency of traditional methods of measuring passive parameters, and may provide a 
      tool for better understanding of voltage-clamp results.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> A local model for transparent motions based on spatiotemporal filters</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Psychophysical studies suggest that humans perceive moving sine plaids as 
      fused when the underlying component gratings are of sufficiently different speed, orientation, 
      and contrast (Adelson &amp; Movshon 1982; Welch, 1990). Other experiments indicate that for 
      short presentation times, the velocities of fused type II sine plaids are not always consistent 
      with the intersection of constraints. We propose a gradient inhibition model that explains these 
      phenomena using only local intensity information. Computational results show a contrast 
      dependent transition for splitting/fusion of sine plaid images. This model suggests that 
      transparency information can be locally computed and subsequently fed into global vision 
      modules.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> Cortical Cells Should Fire Regularly, But Do Not</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> The standard theory of a leaky integrator with stochastic spike input 
      predicts that cortical cells should fire regularly. We tested interspike-interval histograms 
      from awake, behaving macaque visual cortex (Vl and MT), and found high levels of variability (CV 
      &gt; 0.5) characteristic of a nearly random (Poisson) process. A simple integrate-and-fire model, 
      using accepted biophysical parameters, fails by more than a factor of ten to account for the 
      high CV. We also simulated a biophysically detailed compartment-model of an anatomically 
      reconstructed and physiologically characterized layer V pyramidal cell; again, at high firing 
      rate, CV values are low, in disagreement with the data. Only a few situations could account for 
      this discrepency: very large EPSP's, a very short membrane time constant (Tm &lt; 0.3 msec), or 
      highly correlated (e.g. synchronized) input. Our analysis suggests that cortical computation may 
      occur at a time-scale much faster than previously realized.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> Using Parallel Supercomputers for Computational Neurobiology</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> We present our experiences in providing the GENESIS neural simulation system 
      on two different parallel supercomputers one of which is currently the world's fastest computer 
      (Intel Touchstone Delta). Two distinct methods of utilising the power of these novel 
      architecture machines are presented. One method (Task Farming) scales by order 'N' with the 
      number of nodes used, and is particularly useful for examining large parameter spaces. The other 
      method (Distributed Modelling with Internode Communication) allows construction of neural models 
      of a size and computational complexity not hitherto able to be achieved using conventional 
      supercomputing platforms.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> Computations in tactile sensing</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Our tactile sensation is the culmination of a series of events : Physical 
      contact with an object causes mechanical loading on tlle skin surface and results in distortions 
      of mechanoreceptors;; the receptors, in turn, respond with electrical impulse trains hlat are 
      subsequently processed by the nervous system. In this paper, we present detection of slip, 
      microtexture, shape, alld compliance as examples of computations in tactile sensillg. We draw 
      upon results from our experiments on the biomechanics, neurophysiology, and psychophysics of 
      tactile sense, as well as theoretical analyses employing tlle mechanics of deformable media.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> Limitations of the Hodgkin-Huxley Formalism: Effects of Single Channel Kinetics 
      upon Transmembrane Voltage Dynamics</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> The effects of random fluctuations of single ion channels upon transmembrane 
      voltage dynamics are investigated with the example of the giant axon of the squid Loligo. A 
      simulation using the continuous, deterministic Hodgkin-Huxley equations is compared to a 
      simulation using discrete, stochastic ion channel populations modeled as Markov processes. The 
      relative convergence and divergence of the membrane behavior predicted by the two alternative 
      simulations is compared. It is demonstrated that random microscopic behavior, such as single 
      channel fluctuations,can producerandom macrosopic behavior, such as action potentials, under 
      many common biophysical conditions. The various parameters contributing to the amplification of 
      this channel noise are analyzed and estimates for the noise sensitivity of a given membrane are 
      derived. Many interesting biological adaptations have evolved to either exploit or suppress 
      thischannel noise. These biological regimes are surveyed and their computational significance is 
      considered.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> A Model of Direction Selectivity in Visual Cortex Using Massive Intracortical 
      Connections</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Almost all models of orientation and direction-selectivity in visual cortex 
      are based on feed-forward connection schemes, where geniculate input provides all excitation to 
      both pyramidal and inhibitory neurons. The latter neurons then veto the response of the former 
      for non-optimal stimuli. However, the majority of the synaptic input on any cortical cell is 
      provided by other cortical cells. Based on the canonical microcircuit of Douglas \&amp; Martin 
      (1991), we simulate here this massive excitatory and inhibitory synaptic convergence in order to 
      explain a number of puzzling features about direction selective simple cells. In this model, 
      weak geniculate input is dramatically amplified by the action of intracortical excitation, while 
      inhibition has a dual role: (i) to prevent the early geniculate-induced excitation in the null 
      direction and (ii) to serve as gain-control element.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> The highs and lows of horizontal sound localization: The biophysics of 
      Structure-Function correlations in nucleus laminaris.</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Computer simulations designed to study horizontal sound localization suggest 
      that morphological differences between homologous neurons in barn owls and other birds are 
      related to the range of frequencies employed and to the biophysical algorithm used for 
      &quot;coincidence detection&quot;. Barn owls measure interaural phase differences from 3 - 9 kHz. 
      The cells performing this function are a-dendritic and receive many synapses from each side. In 
      simulation, coherent phase-locked inputs produce a synaptic modulation at the stimulus frequency 
      that is proportional to interaural phase difference, being absent for out-of-phase binaural 
      inputs. Spike generators selective for rapid voltage modulations can thus be used for 
      coincidence detection. Modifications of the Hodgkin-Huxley model were found that enable such 
      selectivity. In contrast, chickens use lower frequencies and have coincidence detectors with 
      long bipolar dendrites and long, thin axon initial segments. These can provide greater temporal 
      discrimination at the expense of high frequency responsiveness. High and low frequency 
      coincidence detection may therefore be achieved by different anatomical and biophysical means.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> A multi-Neuronal Vectorial Phase-space analysis for detecting Dynamical 
      interactions in firing patterns of Biological Neural</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> A novel vectorial statistic is introduced to detect temporally correlated 
      firing patterns in a network of n neurons. A &quot;cross-interval&quot; vector is used to 
      establish the temporal relationship of cross-intervals between firings in neurons. The resultant 
      vectorial sum of these vectors provides a statistical measure of an n-tuple correlation among 
      all n neurons in the network in contrast to the pair-wise correlation limitation in 
      cross-correlation analysis. The normalized resultant vectors not only capture and reduce an 
      O(n3) combinatorial correlation to an O(n) vectorial statistic but also provide quantitative 
      descriptions of dynamical interactions from the trajectories and clusters of these vectors in 
      the phase-plane. It provides another unique technique to analyze the interactions among multiple 
      processes in a nonlinear dynamical system.</p>

      <p><b>Abstract:</b> The activity patterns of primary sensory interneurons in the cricket cercal 
      sensory system encode information about the direction and velocity of air current stimuli in the 
      animal's immediate environment. The statistical principles of information theory were used to 
      calculate the maximum directional accuracy attainable from the response ensemble of 8 
      interneurons in this system. These calculations of encoding accuracy took into account the 
      temporal patterns of the spike train patterns, and a canonical discriminant analysis was used to 
      reduce the number of dimensions of the response to a few significant ones. The response of the 
      system in the canonical coordinates could be fitted by sine functions of 360 and 180 degree 
      periods.</p>

      within whose boundaries a region of the rat's face is somatotopically mapped. At patch 
      boundaries, however, there are discontinuities after which a new, not necessarily peripherally 
      adjoining region is mapped. The granule cells which receive these inputs project to the 
      molecular layer which contains the dendrites of the Purkinje cells. In this layer the granule 
      cell axons bifurcate forming the parallel fibers which run parallel to each other for several 
      millimeters across patch boundaries contacting numerous Purkinje cells along their length. Bower 
      and Woolston (1983) found that the shortest latency tactile projections to the Purkinje cells in 
      this region were spatially congruent to those in the granule cell layer. That is, activated 
      Purkinje cells were directly over activated granule cells. This suggested that the ascending 
      portion of the granule cell axon (which synapses on Purkinje cells on the way up) was 
      responsible for this short latency response.</p>
      <p>In these experiments we record from a Purkinje cell while stimulating perioral regions 
      projecting to the underlying granule cells, constructing a peri-stimulus time histogram (PST) 
      from the spikes recorded from 300 trials. Then, the stimulus is moved to other regions which 
      project to patches in the same folium but removed from the Purkinje cell. In separate trials, 
      both regions which send parallel fibers to the Purkinje cell and some which don't are stimulated. 
      Comparing the PSTs from the various trials, we conclude that the short latency excitatory 
      response is mediated by the input from the ascending portion of the granule cell axon only. 
      There is a prolonged, longer latency response starting approximately 40 ms after the stimulus 
      and lasting for 100 to 400 ms which is mediated by the parallel fibers. There is little or no 
      response to stimuli in regions not connected by the parallel fibers. Lastly, we are able to 
      discriminate between the simple spikes in Purkinje cells generated by the two granule cell 
      inputs and the complex spikes generated by the other input pathway, the climbing fibers from 
      the inferior olive. We have not been able to statistically link the climbing fiber pathway to 
      the generation of either the short or long latency responses.</p>
      <p>The results of these experiments are studied in the context of a new interpretation of the 
      functional significance of cerebellar cortical architecture. Purkinje cells respond to specific 
      information relayed via the ascending branch in the context of more subtle modulation provided 
      by the parallel fibers. This allows a new understanding of the fractured somatotopic 
      organization of mossy fiber projections.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> A Computational Model of the Cat Subcortical Auditory System</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> A literal computational model of the cat subcortical auditory system, from 
      the cochlea to the medial geniculate body of the thalamus is described. The model includes 
      subunits representing the basilar membrane/hair cell system of the cochlea, parts of the 
      cochlear nucleus, the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus and the ventral division of the 
      medial geniculate body in the thalamus. Each subunit consists of model neurons whose structure, 
      dynamics and connectivity are based as much as possible on what is known of the cat auditory 
      system. The goal of this modeling effort is to shed light on the role of (1) the 
      convergent/divergent projections seen between each stage of the auditory system and (2) the 
      efferent projections sent from higher stages to lower.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> Lateral Processing: the Time it Takes</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> A novel analytical approach is presented, which allows studying the dynamics 
      of reciprocally connected networks of integrate-and-fire model neurons. Synaptic interactions 
      are modelled at the level of conductance changes, and firing rate adaptation is induced by a 
      spike-activated intrinsic potassium conductance. One obtains both the attractor states of the 
      network and the full spectrum of time constants of the transients leading to those attractor 
      states. Using parameters appropriate to neocortical pyramidal cells, one can estimate, from the 
      slowest transients, the time required for lateral processing, and compare with new experimental 
      data on the time course of single-cell responses in behaving primates.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> Analysis of the distribution of geniculate afferents upon pyramidal neurons in 
      turtle visual cortex</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Pyramidal neurons in the lateral visual cortex receive geniculate afferents 
      upon their proximal dendrites, while those in the medial part receive geniculate afferents upon 
      their distal dendrites. Geniculate EPSPs recorded in vitro from the somata of lateral pyramidal 
      neurons consist of 2-3 unitary EPSPs distributed over a time window of 25 msec while medially 
      located pyramidal neurons exhibit 5 or more unitary EPSPs over 100 msec The very different 
      waveforms generated in lateral versus medial pyramidal neurons can be understood by the 
      differences in the distribution of geniculate afferents upon their dendritic arbors. Supported

      <p><b>Title:</b> Noradrenergic modulation of synaptic transmission in piriform cortex</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> We have demonstrated that bath-applied norepinephrine in doses ranging from 
      10 - 50 uM can cause a long-lasting increase in the strength of intrinsic excitatory synaptic 
      evoked potentials, which may imply that it is serving as a &quot;learning switch&quot; to 
      increase plasticity during behaviorally relevant situations. Norepinephrine treatment initially 
      causes a rapid and dose-dependent suppression of synaptic transmission at excitatory intrinsic 
      fiber synapses in rat piriform cortex, similar to but weaker than the response to the 
      acetylcholine agonist carbachol reported in an earlier study (Hasselmo and Bower 1991). Unlike 
      carbachol, in roughly half the cases investigated large increases in excitatory evoked potentials 
      occurred upon withdrawal of norepinephrine from the medium, without using tetanizing stimuli. We 
      are incorporating these findings into our realistic models of associative memory function in 
      piriform cortex.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> Realistic Simulation of Undulatory Locomotion A Trailing Oscillator 
      Hypothesis</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> In vertebrates like eel and lamprey a laterally directed wave is propagated 
      down the body, pushing the animal forwards through the water. Whereas the function of the 
      segmental neuronal network underlying locomotion (lamprey) is understood, the intersegmental 
      coordination has remained enigmatic. Each spinal segment is connected by excitatory interneurons 
      from neighbouring segments. Our model (7 to 20 segments) of this experimentally established 
      network generates intersegmental coordination. Furthermore the phase lag can be graded and made 
      to change sign, (enabling forward and backward swimming), by adding extra excitation only to one 
      segment in the rostral or caudal part of the oscillator chain.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> Modeling Stimulus Specific Habituation: The Role of the Primordial 
      Hippocampus</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> We present a neural model for the organization and neural dynamics of the 
      medial pallium, the toad's homolog of mammalian hippocampus. A neural mechanism, called 
      cumulative shrinking, is proposed for mapping temporal responses into a form of population 
      coding referenced by spatial positions. Synaptic plasticity is modeled as an interaction of two 
      dynamic processes which simulates both short-term and long-term memory. Successful modeling 
      allows us to provide an account of the neural mechanisms of stimulus specific habituation. A set 
      of model predictions is presented, conceming mechanisms of habituation and cellular organization 
      of the medial pallium.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> Synchronization Among Inhibitory Model Neurons: Interplay Between Rebound 
      Excitation and Synaptic Kinetics</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> It is well known that mutual inhibition in a neuronal network can lead to 
      alternating rhythmic patterns of electrical activity. Here, in contrast, we show with a 
      theoretical model that mutually inhibitory cells, capable of post-inhibitory rebound, can be 
      synchronized to zero phase difference, provided that synaptic activation decays slowly enough to 
      outlast the presynaptic excitation. This study is motivated by consideration of a hypothesis on 
      synchronizing mechanisms for the thalamocortical 10 Hz spindle rhythms, that the reticular 
      thalamic nucleus (RTN) plays a role of pacemaker or synchronizer of spindles in the thalamus. 
      Our results suggest that synchronization among GABAergic RTN cells can be mediated by GABA-B 
      postsynaptic receptors which possess the required kinetic properties.</p>

      <p><b>Abstract:</b> The recent neurophysiological experiments revealed that the spatial 
      synchronization of neural activity across a population of oscillatory neurons exist in the

      experiments.Simulations on the responses of one- and two-dimensional coupled limit-cycle 
      oscillators to two short bar stimuli of varying gap distance and on the phase transitions of 
      coexisting chaotic attractors of coupled chaotic oscillators to different coded inputs are 
      performed.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> Designing Networks of Spiking Silicon Neurons and Synapses</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Carver Mead has pioneered the use of analog VLSI for building silicon 
      systems based on neurobiological principles. As the computational and communication benefits of 
      spiking neurons become more appreciated, there is a growing interest in increasingly realistic 
      &quot;silicon neuron&quot; circuits. Many groups are developing silicon synapses, which, 
      combined with the silicon neurons, will allow the creation of large biologically realistic 
      networks of spiking neurons on a single piece of silicon. As these networks become more and more 
      sophisticated, there will be a need for simulation tools that are appropriate for the circuit 
      primitives. This paper describes simple but realistic silicon neurons, synapses, and a fast 
      event-driven simulator optimized for networks of these analog silicon neurons and synapses. The 
      silicon neuron and synapse circuits have been fabricated and successfully tested, both 
      individually and in small networks. Examples are presented from working chips and compared to 
      results from the simulator.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> Entrainment of the Lampraey locomotor CPG: analysis and simulation</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> Entrainment of a chain of neural oscillators by an external oscillator 
      coupled at one end has been simulated, using connectionist networks. The unit oscillator of the 
      chain consists of synaptically coupled cells postulated to form the basis of the central pattern 
      generator for locomotion in the lamprey. The frequency range over which one-to-one entrainment 
      occurs has been determined for different forms of intersegmental coupling. The dependence of 
      this entrainment range on the characteristics of coupling, and the effect of entrainment on 
      intersegmental phase lags have been investigated and compared with the predictions of 
      mathematical analysis of oscillator chains.</p>

      Phenomenon</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> We present an explanation for the formation of field discontinuities (FDs) 
      in the visual cortical maps of various mammals. Simulating retinocortical map formation with 
      selforganizing feature maps (SFMs), we find a critical influence of the geometry of target area 
      boundaries on the global structure of the map. One or more FDs are formed as the elongation of 
      the cortical area increases. This is in good agreement with the general observation that second 
      order transformations of the visual field are found in elongated areas only. The observation of 
      islands in the visual field representation of cat A18/19 is explained by the occurrence of more 
      than one FD. Generally the maps show a local increase of the areal magnification factor near the 
      origin of the FD. This prediction might be accessible to future experiments.</p>

      <p><b>Title:</b> Spatial and temporal integration by locust nonspiking interneurons: 
      Voltage-dependent electrical geometry.</p>
      <p><b>Abstract:</b> We constructed a simplified computer model of a locust nonspiking 
      interneuron, using morphological features from intracellular cobalt and HRP fills, and 
      biophysical parameters determined from voltage-clamp studies. The model has 56 compartments, a 
      leak and 2 voltage-activated K conductances with different kinetics of activation and 
      inactivation. These active conductances are known from current-clamp experiments to lead to a 
      ten-fold change in membrane time constant over the normal operating range of the interneurons. 
      We ran numerical simulation experiments to study the changes in apparent space constant with 
      membrane voltage. We found that the electrical geometry of a nonspiking interneuron can be 
      dramatically altered by small changes in membrane voltage, leading to compartmentalization at 
      the more positive potentials.</p></li>
