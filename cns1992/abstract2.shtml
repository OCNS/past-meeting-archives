  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Dynamic phenomenia in the olfactory bulb II</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> A mathematical model has been given to demonstrate the associative memory 
  	  character of the olfactory bulb. Odor qualities are coded in distributed spatial amplitude 
  	  patterns. Differential equations for the mitral and granule cell activities have been 
  	  supplemented by a continuous-time local learning rule. A nonlinear forgetting term and a 
  	  selective decreasing term is added to the Hebbian learning rule. A learned odor can be recalled 
  	  by a subset of the pattern. There is a strict restriction on the parameters: only those values 
  	  can be admitted which generate physiologically justified activity signals.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Gated--Enhancer Model for Motion Facilitation in Retinal Directional 
  	  Selectivity</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Directionally selective ganglion cells respond to preferred--direction 
  	  motions more strongly than predicted by the sum of the responses to stationary stimuli covering 
  	  the same area as the motion. The spatial, temporal, and contrast properties of this motion 
  	  facilitation were recently investigated in rabbit by apparent--motion protocols. These 
  	  properties are inconsistent with facilitation models based either on threshold or 
  	  membrane--conductance modulation. However, these properties are consistent with models in which 
  	  an enhancer agent induced by motion facilitates responses evoked later along the motion 
  	  trajectory. The data indicate that the enhancer would itself not produce excitation until gated 
  	  by the later excitation. Simulations using Surf--Hippo, a new retinal simulator, support a 
  	  dendritic implementation of this ``gated--enhancer&quot; model.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Cholinergic modulation of assoclative memory function in a realistic 
  	  computational model of piriform cortex</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> A detailed model of piriform cortex developed with the GENESIS simulation 
  	  package shows associative memory properties such as completion. This model allows analysis of 
  	  the role of acetylcholine in cortical associative memory function. Experiments demonstrate that 
  	  acetylcholine causes selective suppression of synaptic transmission at excitatory intrinsic 
  	  fiber synapses in piriform cortex (Hasselmo and Bower, 1992). When applied during learning in 
  	  the model, this selective cholinergic suppression prevents interference between overlapping 
  	  input patterns, allowing separate and distinct learning of input stimuli. This selective 
  	  suppression may act in concert with the cholinergic increase in excitability to modulate 
  	  piriform cortex associative memory function.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> The Neurone Describing function : A Single Compartment Study</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> In artificial neural networks, units usually perform a sigmoid function of 
  	  the weighted sum of their inputs. By Taylor series expansion, it can be shown that these 
  	  networks compute a constrained Volterra series of their inputs. As a descriptor of real neurone 
  	  behaviour this approach fails because neurones have dynamic properties and do not have a 
  	  separate linear stage. Using compartmental modelling, describing functions of neurones can be 
  	  approximated. This approach demonstrates a frequency dependent non-linearity not represented by 
  	  a fixed Volterra Kernel. The simulation of real neurones leads to the proposal of alternative 
  	  describing functions for artificial nets.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> A network for semantic and episodic associations revealing thought disturbances 
  	  due to neural loss</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> We study an Attractor Neural Network that stores natural concepts, organized 
  	  in semantic classes. The concepts are represented by distributed patterns over a space of 
  	  attributes, and are related by both semantic and episodic associations. While semantic relations 
  	  are expressed through an hierarchical coding over the attribute space, episodic links are 
  	  realized via specific synaptic projections. Due to dynamic thresholds expressing neuronal 
  	  fatigue, the network's behavior is characterized by convergence toward the concept patterns on a 
  	  short time scale, and by transitions between the various patterns on a longer time scale. The 
  	  network manifests semantic, episodic, and random transitions. Modeling pathological memory 
  	  disturbances, we studied the influence of several parameters on the frequency of semantic and 
  	  episodic transitions. W'hen neurons characterized by a large synaptic connectivity are deleted, 
  	  semantic transitions deteriorate before the episodic ones, in accordance with the findings in 
  	  patients with Alzheimer's disease.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> A Model of the Combined Effects of Chemical and Activity-Dependent Mechanisms 
  	  in Topographic Map Formation</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> A simulated model of the effects of chemical and activity-dependent 
  	  mechanisms in to- pographic map formation is presented. These mechanisms work together to allow 
  	  rapid development of detailed maps. The model matches experimental results on the ability to 
  	  form rough, but not refined, maps in the absence of electrical activity, expansion of heavily 
  	  stimulated areas, and formation of ocular dominance columns. This work explains and resolves 
  	  problems with previous models, including the need to use non-biological input representations, 
  	  slow convergence rates, and problems with orientation and formation of discontinous sub-maps.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Synaptic deletion and compensation in Alzheimer disease: A neural model</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Recent experimental evidence testifies to the possible role of synaptic 
  	  deletion and compensation in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). As a clinical 
  	  hallmark of AD is memory degradation, these processes are examined in the framework of a neural 
  	  network model of associative memory. Using a network with fixed memory load we vary two 
  	  parameters, the deletion of synapses and the total synaptic strength, and observe the 
  	  characteristic turnover from a memory-retrieval phase to total memory loss. Several synaptic 
  	  compensation strategies, that patients may employ depending on their synaptic regenerative 
  	  potential, are specified and examined. Reviewing the neuroanatomical and clinical data, we show 
  	  that our model can account for the variation in the severity and progression rate of AD.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Morphological basis of wind stimulus discrimination in the cricket cercal 
  	  sensory system</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> The functional organization of a sensory map in a simple insect sensory 
  	  system was studied using a combination of anatomical and electrophysiological techniques. 
  	  Analysis of the map indicates that air current direction is represented in a continuous fashion 
  	  within the map. Directionally selective primary sensory interneurons extract directional 
  	  information from the map by virtue of the position of their dendritic arbors within the map. To 
  	  test this structure-function hypothesis we have modeled the directional tuning curves of 
  	  primary sensory interneurons based on the anatomical relationships between the interneurons and 
  	  the map. The predicted tuning curves are very similar to the experimentally observed curves.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Prolonged depolarizations following brief synaptic stimulations in the 
  	  cerebellar Purkinje cell: Intracellular recordings and compartmental modelling</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Intracellular recordings were obtained from Purkinje cells in the guinea pig 
  	  slice preparation. Electrical stimulation pulses of 0.1 ms duration delivered to the granule 
  	  cell layer resulted in 100 to 300 ms lasting depolarizations in Purkinje cells. During these 
  	  depolarizations the cells often showed an increase of spiking frequency. Pulses of synchronous 
  	  synaptic activation in a compartmental model of the Purkinje cell resulted in similar prolonged 
  	  depolarizations. In the model, prolonged depolarizations are due to the opening of voltage 
  	  dependent calcium channels. Increases of spiking frequency with a similar time course can be 
  	  observed in vivo with brief (5ms) tactile stimulation, suggesting that the active membrane 
  	  properties of individual Purkinje cells observed in vitro and in the model contribute to the 
  	  modulatiGn of Purkinje cell activity via the parallel fiber system in the functioning network.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Outline of a Theory of Isocortex</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> We outline a theory of six-layered, homeotypic cortex that includes 
  	  mechanisms for pattern selec- tivity, hierarchical category recognition and sequence learning. 
  	  Learnable inhibitory feedback between layers of cortex acts to shift the activation threshold 
  	  for pattern-recognizing cells, causing them to become tuned to specific patterns of afferents. 
  	  The final amount of inhibition will be a function of the &quot;size&quot; of the pattern 
  	  recognized by the cell. The inhibition can therefore be applied to other pattern-recognizing 
  	  cells to implement a &quot;masking field&quot; (Grossberg, 1985). Grossberg, S., The adaptive

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> A model for dynamical aspects of visual attention</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> A model is presented to investigate the role of feedback pathways from 
  	  association cortical areas to Vl and LGN in attentional mechanisms. In the model,these pathways 
  	  are shown to be capable of modifying the tuning properties of lower level neurons, hence 
  	  quickening their convergence. Model simulations use an algorithm (Alopex) that is implementable 
  	  by known neural circuitry. The change in tuning properties of V4 and IT neurons in the monkey 
  	  has lead to the hypothesis that these changes play a role in the static aspects of attention. 
  	  Our results show that this may instead be a dynamic phenomenon,helping the visual system to 
  	  focus attention rapidly.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> NMDA-Activated Conductances Provide Short-Term Memory for Dendritic Spine Logic 
  	  Computations</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Active conductances in dendritic spines may permit elaborate computational 
  	  processing of multiple synaptic inputs long before these signals reach the soma. Numerical 
  	  models of dendritic trees indicate that the interactions of postsynaptic potentials in active 
  	  spines can generate simple logic operations such as AND, OR and NAND gates. However, because the 
  	  spine head EPSP's closely follow the underlying, short-duration (1-3 ms), synaptic conductances, 
  	  previous studies concluded that the precise timing of synaptic inputs is critical for these 
  	  logic operations. We show that this severe temporal limitation on dendritic computation can be 
  	  overcome by the inclusion of slow (100-300 ms), voltage-dependent, NMDA-receptor mediated 
  	  conductances$^5$ in the spine heads. Our numerical simulations show that this simple mechanism 
  	  provides a short term memory ($\sim$ 100 ms) for logical AND gates with time-delayed inputs on 
  	  one or more spines.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> NMDA Receptors and Hyperexcitability in Human Hippocampal Granule Cells</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Hippocampal granule cells from patients with certain types of temporal lobe 
  	  epilepsy have been found to exhibit abnormal electrophysiological and pathological properties. 
  	  In particular, intracellular recordings in slice preparations from human patients with medial 
  	  temporal lobe sclerosis show an enhacement of the NMDA component of the EPSP relative to normal 
  	  human or rodent tissues.1 In addition, the axons of the granule cells in the diseased tissue 
  	  have been observed to sprout recurrent fibers back to the proximal dendritic layers of the 
  	  granule cells.2 A comparison of the results of the experimental measurements with the analysis 
  	  of numerical multi-compartmental models incorporating the electrophysiological properties of 
  	  these abnormal cells indicates a possible mechanism by which the enhanced NMDA mediated 
  	  conductance and the axonal feed-back can lead to the observed hyperexcitability of these cells 
  	  that may be responsible for epileptic activity.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> A Method for Estimating the Neural Input to a Neuron using the Ionic Current 
  	  Model </p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> The ionic current properties of a neuron play a key role in information 
  	  processing in neural systems. These ionic currents can be described mathematically similar to 
  	  Hodgkin-Huxley equations based on voltage clamp experiments. Such an ionic current model 
  	  provides a basis for understanding the neuronal function and for calculating the individual 
  	  ionic currents from experimentally recorded voltage responses. Here, we propose a method to 
  	  estimate the total input current to the neuron which produces the voltage response by using the 
  	  model. We first applied the method to Hodgkin-Huxley model and confirmed that the input current 
  	  is estimated correctly. Secondly, we applied the method to retinal horizontal cell response and 
  	  analyzed the estimated total input current for the voltage responses with various light stimuli. 
  	  Finally we discussed the role of individual ionic current in the horizontal cell membrane and 
  	  the underlying mechanisms of the nonlinear dynamical voltage response.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Dissipative Structures and Self-Organizing Criticality in Neural Networks with 
  	  Spatially Localized Connections.</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Neural networks with asymmetric random connections may converge to simple 
  	  attractors or they may behave chaotically. If, however, the probability of neu- ral 
  	  interconnection in a network is related to the distance between neurons, as it is in the brain, 
  	  then a third class of behavior (which could be used in coding representation), dissipative 
  	  structure formation, becomes possible. Simulations of such networks showed that dissipative 
  	  structures could form, however, this required biologically implausible fine-tuning of the 
  	  networks' parameters. Further studies showed that conditions in which dissipative structure 
  	  formation was likely could be produced by uniform low intensity stimulation of these networks 
  	  through a process of self-organizing criticality. This mechanism eliminates the requirement for 
  	  biologically implausible fine-tuning of networks thereby increasing the probability that 
  	  dissipative structures may play a functional role in processing information in the brain.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Deterministic Entropy Measures for Investigating Complex SpatioTemporal Order 
  	  in Multi-Unit Spike Train Data</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> We consider the hypothesis that within a neural population, the distribution 
  	  of cell firing times is chaotic, characterized by a finite Kolmogorov entropy. We contrast this 
  	  with the alternative rate code hypothesis, which asserts that the distribution of cell firing 
  	  times is ergodic, possessing an infinite Kolmogorov entropy. Starting from an explicit 
  	  expression for the entropy of a train of uncorrelated events, characteristic features for the 
  	  entropy of any ergodic process are inferred. Entropy growth that is slower than logarithmic at 
  	  increased temporal resolutions, as well as anomalous renormalization flow, is argued to be a 
  	  sufficient indicator of an underlying chaotic order. Stereotypical results are illustrated 
  	  through the analysis of computer generated spike train data. A parallel algorithm for extracting 
  	  the spike train entropy is provided.</p>

  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> The lateral eye of Limulus provides an unique opportunity to investigate 
  	  retinal function and the neural code of vision. We have integrated computational, physiological,

  	  and the efferent modulation of the eye by the brain. We developed a cell-based computational 
  	  model of the eye on a parallel computer (Connection Machine). The model structure is related 
  	  closely to the anatomical structure of the eye and the parameters are estimated from 
  	  experimental data. Model computations are combined with behavioral data to investigate the 
  	  neural representation of the animal's visual world.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Assembly Formation and Segregation by a Self-organizing Neuronal Oscillator 
  	  Model</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Experimental evidence demonstrates the stimulus-dependent formation and 
  	  segregation of neuronal assemblies defined by coherent oscillatory response patterns. In this 
  	  paper, we investigate whether the self-organization of synchronizing and desynchronizing 
  	  connections can establish a corresponding temporal response structure using local learning rules. 
  	  Motivated by recent experimental observations, synchronizing connections are modified according 
  	  to a two-threshold Hebb-like learning rule, while we generalize this rule to analogous 
  	  Anti-Hebb-like weight changes for the desynchronizing connections. We show that the resulting 
  	  network exhibits synchronization and segregation of oscillatory activity in agreement with the 
  	  experiment.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Absence of Learning in Hyperacuity</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Human observers with previous experience in psychophysical methods were 
  	  tested on 34 different non-stereo and 33 stereo hyperacuity tasks. None of the observers had any 
  	  previous experience with non-stereo hyperacuity task. The preliminary results showed no learning 
  	  for the non-stereo tasks. The initial performancesQdefined by pooling the first five responses 
  	  for each of the 34 stimuliQwere well within hyperacuity range. All observers had experience in 
  	  stereo discrimination; their pooled initial five to ten responses indicated no initial practice 
  	  effects for stereo discrimination in the fixation plane, but quite a rapid learning rate for 
  	  stereo discrimination 5' off the fixation plane. Mechanisms of visual hyperacuity do not appear 
  	  to require learning or other processes to improve performance with practice.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> The use of genetic algorithms to explore neural mechanisms that optimize 
  	  rhythmic behaviors: Quasi-realistic models of feeding behavior in Aplysia</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Using simple neural models, we have been studying how behavior (feeding) can 
  	  be optimized. The effects of circuit parameters are studied by exhaustive search or genetic 
  	  algorithms. The findings indicate: 1) A defined two neuron-two muscle system can generate 
  	  rhythmic behavior that can result in a net gain of energy. 2) In the absence of modulatory 
  	  inputs, the efficiency of the system sharply degrades when individual parameters are varied only 
  	  a small percentage from those used to evolve the system. It is postulated that various forms of

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> A model for self-regulation of Neuronal activity</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> We constructed a conductance-based model from biophysical data of a 
  	  stomatogastric ganglion neuron. Using this model, we address the question of stability of 
  	  neuronal activity despite changes in both the internal and external environment. We propose that 
  	  calcium could act as a regulatory signal to adjust the ratio of conductances expressed by a 
  	  neuron. We show that the internal calcium concentration is highly correlated with electrical 
  	  properties and we build a feedback mechanism to link calcium to the maximal conductance of each 
  	  current. Models with dynamical maximal conductances can self-assemble the currents they need to 
  	  produce a given target activity pattern from an arbitrary initial state and can recover from 
  	  drastic changes in extracellular ionic concentration. This mechanism allows increased robustness 
  	  and activity-dependent stabilization of network function.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Understanding the Functional Goals of Retinal Ganglion Cells</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> In mammalian retina, the Y (or M) ganglion cells are significantly more 
  	  transient in response, more selective to stimuli of low spatial and high temporal frequencies, 
  	  and less selective to spectral information than the X (or P) cells. It is shown that these 
  	  differences in cell properties can be explained by a model that assigns different functional 
  	  goals to the different ganglion cell types. In this model, the goal of the Y cells is to extract 
  	  as fast as possible the minimum amount of information necessary for quick responses. In contrast, 
  	  the goal of the X cells is to extract as much information as possible. Temporal characteristics 
  	  of the information extraction by the two cell groups are also derived.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Acetylcholine and cortical oscillatory dynamics</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Acetylcholine appears to regulate the oscillatory properties of cortical 
  	  structures. Application of cholinergic agonists induces theta rhythm oscilla- tory patterns in 
  	  the piriform (olfactory) cortex (Biedenbach, 1966) and the hippocampus (Konopacki et al., 1987). 
  	  These effects appear due to alter- ation of the intrinsic oscillatory characteristics of 
  	  cortical structures. In a simulation of the oscillatory dynamics of piriform cortex (Liljenstrom, 
  	  1991), we show that the neuromodulatory effects of acetylcholine can induce theta rhythm 
  	  oscillatory characteristics. The cholinergic increase in excitability causes increased 
  	  oscillatory activity while the cholinergic suppression of ex- citatory intrinsic synaptic 
  	  transmission prevents gamma rhythm oscillatory dynamics from predominating.</p>

  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> An original model of the specialist olfactory system of insects, built in a

  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Parameters in network models can be adjusted using algorithms that optimize 
  	  the fit between the response of neurons in the model and biological system. Often, however, more 
  	  is known about behavior than neuronal responses. Using chemotaxis in the nematode C. elegans as 
  	  a model system, we adapted a recurrent backpropagation algorithm to optimize parameters using 
  	  behavioral data alone. In this form, backpropagation successfully optimized a dynamical network 
  	  to chemotax in a simple environment. This sets the stage for the use of optimization techniques 
  	  in more realistic models of the anatomically well-defined nervous system of C. elegans.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Intrinsic oscillations in simulated thalamocortical relay cells</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Thalamocortical relay cells show a rich repertoire of oscillatory behaviors 
  	  depending on membrane voltage: 1- 3 Hz slow wave oscillations, 8-10 Hz spindle oscillations and 
  	  100 Hz repetitive spiking. We have looked at the intrinsic dynamics of a model relay cell with 
  	  realistic geometry and 9 voltage-sensitive channels. Spindling and slow wave oscillation could 
  	  be reproduced in the model but were just two points along a spectrum of oscillation rate that 
  	  varied with degree of hyperpolarization. Simulated cortical stimulation was effective ln phase 
  	  resetting of either rhythm and could entrain the slower rhythm to higher frequencies.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> A Neural Model for a Randomized Frequency-Spatial Transformation</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> This work addresses the question whether information encoded in the neuronal 
  	  firing frequency can be transformed into spatial encoding. If neurons with a broad spectrum of 
  	  membrane time constants (MTC) exist, or a precisely wired circuitry incorporating delay lines is 
  	  assumed, a frequency-spatial transformation (FST) is clearly possible. However, various cortical 
  	  regions are composed of neurons with short MTCs, which are randomly connected with each other. 
  	  Introducing a stochastic component into the neurons' dynamics, we present a FST scheme which 
  	  incorporates random connections and requires memory in a limited sense. Our scheme is presented 
  	  and analyzed for a feed-forward network. We also discuss its applicability for a random network, 
  	  and present some supporting simulation results.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Large Nonlinear Pattern Discrimination in Dendritic Trees</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> A recent compartmental modeling study showed that a dendritic tree rich in 
  	  NMDA-type synaptic channels is selectively responsive to spatially clustered, as opposed to 
  	  diffuse, pattens of synaptic activation \cite{mel:neuralcomp}. This ``cluster-sensitivity'' 
  	  property was shown to be a sufficient mechanism to underlie true nonlinear pattern 
  	  discrimination at the single cell level. The effects of other physiologically-characterized 
  	  nonlinear membrane mechanisms have now been tested with respect to dendritic cluster-sensitivity, 
  	  including voltage-dependent sodium and calcium channels of various kinetics and in various 
  	  spatial distributions. Under loose assumptions, the capacity for nonlinear pattern 
  	  discrimination can be greatly enhanced by the presence of excitatory voltage-dependent membrane 
  	  channels. An abstract model neuron, called a {\sl clusteron}, is shown to capture important 
  	  aspects of the cluster-sensitive input-output behavior of a full biophysically-modeled dendritic 
  	  tree. An analysis of the storage capacity of the {\sl clusteron} is presented, and empirical 
  	  results with a cluster-sensitive Hebb-type learning rule are shown to lead to a large storage 
  	  capacity for nonlinearly-separable pattern sets.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Adaptive Receptive Fields for Textural Segmentation</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Textural segmentation plays an important role in the figure-ground 
  	  discrimination process. Many current models of mechanisms underlying textural segmentation 
  	  assume that texture &quot;contrast&quot; information, captured at the border of two abutting 
  	  textured regions, is sufficient to reconstruct the original surfaces of the textures. These 
  	  approaches are based on the additional assumption that center-surround receptive fields of 
  	  visual neurons are perfectly balanced; a uniform stimulus pattern, covering both the center and 
  	  the surround, produces a zero response. We argue that such models would produce incorrect 
  	  reconstructions of textural surfaces, and describe a neural network architecture for textural 
  	  segmentation that can adaptively delimit the boundaries of uniformly textured regions. 
  	  Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the segmentation capabilities of the 
  	  architecture.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> Signaling Local Synaptic Covariance through Space</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> Recent experimental evidence suggests that a rapidly diffusing signal 
  	  produced at active synapses may be a determiner of Hebbian plasticity. We have analysed this new 
  	  mechanism and have considered examples of the different predictions such a local signaling 
  	  mechanism forces: (1) explicit normalisation is not required for the development of ocular 
  	  dominance columns; (2) there is a critical minimum column width; (3) the diffusible signal 
  	  produced at active synapses could be expected to modulate the efficacy of other synaptic 
  	  terminals in the region containing different neurotransmitters; and (4) if the mechanism can act 
  	  over short time-scales, then it can boost the signal/noise ratio through local contrast 
  	  enhancement. We demonstrate these conclusions through simulations performed on an MIMD 
  	  hypercube.</p>

  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> We studied the dependence of the average spike frequency (f-out) of a 
  	  biophysically realistic model neuron on the degree of synchrony (s, varied from 0 to 100%) in 
  	  its excitatory synaptic inputs. The following independent parameters were systematically varied: 
  	  (1) N, the number of inputs to the neuron, (2) f-in, the average frequency of the inputs, and 
  	  (3) w, the strength of the input connection. The goal was to empirically determine the relation: 
  	  f-out = F(N, fin, w, s). The results indicate that for parameter values in the range found in 
  	  neocortical cells, input synchrony can affect output significantly.</p>

  	  <p><b>Title:</b> The architecture of visual cortical orientation columns</p>
  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> The dimension reduction from the multi-dimensional feature space to the 
  	  two-dimensional cortical plane is realized by complex maps which so far have evaded intuitive 
  	  understanding. We show that the most salient features of these maps can be understood from a few 
  	  basic design principles: local correlation, isotropy and homogeneity. We define these principles 
  	  in a mathematically exact sense and we show that they are sufficient to generate realistic 
  	  column structures. We suggest that the reason why most of the previously proposed models of 
  	  orientation columns are capable of generating realistically looking orientation column 
  	  structures is simply that any model which is consistent with the aforementioned principles is 
  	  capable of doing so.</p>

  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> A model is presented to investigate the role of the feedback in the 
  	  development of ocular dominance columns (ODC's) in V1. In the model, the the subplate locally 
  	  integrates the activity of cortical layer IV is feeds it back to the same. Anatomical evidence

  	  <p><b>Abstract:</b> In the cochlea of the cat and other mammals each afferent auditory neuron
