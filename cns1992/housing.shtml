  	<h1>CNS*1992</h1>
  	
  	<h2>The Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting</h2>
  	
  	<h3>July 1992, San Francisco, California</h3>
  	
  	<h4>CNS*1992 Housing</h4>
  	
  	<p>The LaurelHeights Conference Center is located at 3333 California Street (at Presidio), 
  	situated between Presidio Park and the area of San Francisco known as Japan Town.</p>
  	
  	<h4>ACCESSIBILITY:</h4>
  	
  	<p>If you are flying to the meeting, San Francisco Airport is the most convenient, although 
  	Oakland and San Jose airports are also within an hour's drive. From the San Francisco airport, 
  	there are three different shuttle companies that will take you directly to any major S.F. Hotel 
  	for a fee ranging from $9 to $12. The direct driving time is about 20 minutes, if your hotel is 
  	within the first few stops. The shuttle companies are as follows: LORRIE'S, SUPER SHUTTLE SERVICE, 
  	and (like it or not) QUAKE CITY SHUTTLE SERVICE. These shuttle services operate with medium-size 
  	passenger vans that can be boarded on the DEPARTURE LEVEL outside the terminal buildings... simply 
  	get your luggage, lug it back up to the departure level, and walk out to the shuttle 
  	service/public transportation &quot;island&quot; and watch for one of the vans to pull up. They 
  	are constantly shuttling by. NOTE!!! If you are staying at the Miyako Hotel (see below) you must 
  	be sure the driver understands that it is the Miyako HOTEL on Post &amp; Laguna in Japan Town, and 
  	not the Miyako MOTOR INN on Sutter. An alternate way to get to any hotel (which may be quicker and 
  	less expensive, if you are traveling with several others) is to take the BART SHUTTLE or the 
  	DOWNTOWN Transit Terminal Shuttle to the city center and hop a cab to your hotel.</p>
  	
  	<p>If you are driving:</p>
  	
  	<p><b>NORTHERN APPROACH:</b> Drive south on US Highway 101 across golden gate bridge and take Park 
  	Presidio to Lake St. Turn right at lake, go one-half block to 14th Avenue for one block and turn 
  	left on California Street. Follow California for 18 blocks and turn right into 3333 California 
  	St.</p>
  	
  	<p><b>SOUTHERN APPROACH:</b> From the San Francisco Airport, take US Highway 101 north to the Golden Gate 
  	Bridge exit. Follow Golden Gate Bridge signs to Franklin St. Follow Franklin to California; turn 
  	left on California and follow California 14 blocks. Turn left into 3333 California.</p>
  	
  	<p><b>EASTERN APPROACH:</b> Drive across the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and follow US Highway 101 
  	north to the Golden Gate Bridge exit. Then follow instructions for the &quot;SOUTHERN 
  	APPROACH&quot; printed above.</p>
  	
  	<p><b>DRIVERS NOTE:</b> There are a limited number of public parking spaces available at the 
  	conference center at reasonable rates. Parking can be arranged when you get there.</p>
  	
  	<h4>LODGING:</h4>
  	
  	<p>We have reserved blocks of rooms at special rates in two local hotels (the closest to the 
  	comference center). They are:</p>
  	
  	<p>SAN FRANCISCO LAUREL MOTOR INN<br />
  	444 PRESIDIO AVE.<br />
  	SAN FRANCISCO, 94115<br />
  	(415) 567-8467 OR (800) 552-8735</p>
  	
  	<p>MIYAKO HOTEL<br />
  	JAPAN CENTER, 1625 POST STREET (at Laguna)<br />
  	SAN FRANCISCO 94115<br />
  	(415) 922-3200 OR (800) 533-4567</p>
  	
  	<p>NOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!! TO GET THE &quot;SPECIAL&quot; RATES, YOU MUST INDICATE THAT YOU ARE 
  	ASSOCIATED WITH THE &quot;CNS92 MEETING&quot;</p>
  	
  	<p>The Laurel Motor Inn is closer to the Conference center and is less expensive, but there are 
  	only 40 rooms, so if cost is a concern, we urge you to call them as soon as possible. The Laurel 
  	Motor in is directly across the street from the Center. The Miyako Hotel is really swanky and has 
  	enough rooms for everyone. The Miyako is about 8 blocks from the conference center: a refreshing 
  	15 minute walk or a quick (about $3) cab ride. There are no other reputable hotels or motels in 
  	the immediate area... all other alternatives would require significant commute time.</p>
  	
  	<h4>ROOM RATES:</h4>
  	
  	<p>Laurel Motor Inn: Rates vary with occupancy, view, and ammenities (ie: kitchenette.) as 
  	follows:<br />
  	Standard room: $63 for one, $71 for two<br />
  	Standard with kitchenette: $72 for one, 80 for two<br />
  	&quot;city view&quot;: $72 for one, $80 for two<br />
  	city view with kitchenette: $81 for one, $89 for two.<br />
  	These prices include continental Breakfast and parking.</p>
  	
  	<p>Miyako Hotel: One flat rate of (gulp) $95 per room, double or single occupancy. (ie: stay with 
  	a friend and split the rate...)</p>
  	
  	<h4>FOOD:</h4>
  	
  	<p>The conference center has an excellent cafeteria, and remember that all lunches, coffee breaks 
  	and one dinner (the banquet at the exploratorium) are included in your registration fees. For the 
  	unsponsored dinners, you will have no trouble finding local restaurants with excellent food at 
  	reasonable prices. A list of local (and not-so-local) restaurants will be distributed at the 
  	meeting.</p>
  	
  	<h4>WORKSHOP HOUSING</h4>
  	
  	<p>Full accommodation is provided for persons attending the workshops. Starting wednesdaynight 
  	till friday (lunch).</p>
