  	<h1>CNS*2001</h1>
  	
  	<h2>The Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting</h2>
  	
  	<h3>June 30 - July 5, 2001, San Francisco and Pacific Grove, California</h3>
  	
  	<h4>CNS*01 Workshop</h4>
  	
  	<p>Workshops focusing on current issues in computational neuroscience will be held on July 4 and 
  	5, 2001, as part of the CNS*2001 conference in Pacific Grove, California. Potential organizers 
  	are invited to submit proposals for specific workshop topics.</p>
  	
  	<p>Workshops may fall into one of three formats:</p>
  	
  	<ol>
  	  <li>Discussion Workshops (formal or informal)</li>
  	  <li>Tutorials</li>
  	  <li>Mini-symposia or,</li>
  	  <li>They may combine more than one of these formats.</li>
  	</ol>
  	
  	<p>The goal of the workshops is to provide an informal forum within the CNS meeting for focused 
  	discussion of recent or speculative research, novel techniques, and open issues in computational 
  	neuroscience. Discussion workshops, whether formal (i.e., held in a conference room with 
  	projection and writing media) or informal (held elsewhere), should stress interactive and open 
  	discussions in preference to sequential presentations. Tutorials and mini-symposia provide a 
  	format for a focused exploration of particular issues or techniques within a more traditional 
  	presentation framework; in these cases too, adequate time should be reserved for questions and 
  	general discussion. The organizers of a workshop should endeavor to bring together as broad a 
  	range of pertinent viewpoints as possible.</p>
  	
  	<p>In addition to recruiting participants and moderating discussion, workshop organizers should 
  	be prepared to submit a short report, summarizing the presentations and discussion, to the 
  	workshop coordinator shortly after the conference. These reports will be included on the CNS*2001 
  	web site.</p>
  	
  	<h4>HOW TO PROPOSE A WORKSHOP</h4>
  	
  	<p>To propose a workshop, please submit the following information to the workshop coordinator at 
  	the address below:</p>
  	
  	<ol>
  	  <li>the name(s) of the organizer(s)</li>
  	  <li>the title of the workshop</li>
  	  <li>a description of the subject matter, indicating clearly the range of topics to be 
  	  discussed</li>
  	  <li>the format(s) of the workshop; if a discussion session, please specify whether you would 
  	  like it to be held in a conference room or in a less formal setting</li>
  	  <li>for tutorials and mini-symposia, a provisional list of speakers</li>
  	  <li>whether the workshop is to run for one or two days</li>
  	</ol>
  	
  	<p>Please submit proposals as early as possible by email or by post to:</p>
  	
  	<p>Dr. Maneesh Sahani<br />
  	Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit<br />
  	Alexandra House<br />
  	17, Queen Square<br />
  	London, WC1N 3AR, U.K.<br /><br />
  	The descriptions of accepted workshops will appear on the CNS*2001 web site as they are received. 
  	Attendees are encouraged to check this list, and to contact the organizers of any workshops in 
  	which they are interested in participating.</p>
