  	<h2>The Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting</h2>
  	
  	<h3>June 30 - July 5, 2001, San Francisco and Pacific Grove, California</h3>
  	
  	<h4>CNS*01 General Information</h4>
  	
  	<p>CNS*2001 will be held in San Francisco and Pacific Grove, California from June 30 to July 5, 
  	2001. This is the tenth in a series of annual inter-disciplinary conferences intended to address 
  	the broad range of research approaches and issues involved in the general field of computational 
  	neuroscience. As in the previous years, this meeting will bring together experimental and 
  	theoretical neurobiologists along with engineers, computer scientists, cognitive scientists, 
  	physicists, and mathematicians interested in understanding how biological neural systems compute. 
  	The meeting will equally emphasize experimental, model-based, and theoretical approaches to 
  	understanding neurobiological computation. All accepted papers must demonstrate a clear and 
  	direct relationship to biological neural computation.</p>
