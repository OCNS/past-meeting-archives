  	<p><b>Workshop Title:</b> Mathematical Reduction of Complex Neural Models: Methods and Uses of 
  	Reduced Models.</p>
  	<p><b>Moderator:</b> Boris Gutkin</p>
  	<p><b>Description:</b></p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">With increasing computational power, models of single neurons have become 
  	progressively more complicated, reflecting the multiplicity of trans-membrane conductances and 
  	the spatial structure of the neuron. While informative about specific biophysical mechanisms such 
  	models are mathematically unwieldy and do not yield to much formal analysis, nor do they easily 
  	connect with the more abstract neural network models used to study behavior of cell circuits and 
  	assemblies.</p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">In the past several years, a number of mathematical techniques have been 
  	developed that allow one to reduce the mathematical complexity of neural models. The resulting 
  	models go far beyond the classical Integrate-and-Fire neuron in their ability to reproduce 
  	physiological phenomena and are amenable to mathematical analysis. Furthermore, the formal 
  	mathematical method makes it clear what are the assumptions inherent in the reduction process, 
  	and what are the structural and dynamical requirements for the reduction to be applicable.</p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">In this workshop we shall present a survey of modern reduction methods 
  	with some examples of how the reduced models can be used.</p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">Some examples of methods include:</p>
  	<ul>
  	  <li>separation of time scales methods</li>
  	  <li>the spike-response models</li>
  	  <li>reductions using normal forms to give canonical phase models</li>
  	  <li>reduction of weakly and slowly coupled spiking neurons to neural networks</li>
  	</ul>

  	<p><b>Workshop Title:</b> In vivo intracellular recording in vertebrates: How and why?</p>
  	<p><b>Moderator:</b> Dieter Jaeger</p>
  	<p><b>Description:</b></p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">In vivo intracellular recordings in vertebrates are rumoured to be a 
  	frustrating experience best left to others.</p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">In anesthetized animals it may not be so bad, however, depending on brain structure and cell 
  	type.</p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">This workshop will collect the experiences, tips, and frustrations that 
  	the participants have had with in vivo intracellular techniques.</p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">In particular we will address the question of how brain pulsations can be 
  	reduced. Other factors that are important in getting stable recordings, such as electrode shape 
  	and manipulator stability, will be duly noted.</p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">And if we can do such recordings, what should we be using them for? The 
  	organizer claims that good intracellular recordings from behaving animals are the holy grail of 
  	computational neuroscience.</p>

  	<p><b>Workshop Title:</b> Computational Neuroanatomy</p>
  	<p><b>Moderator:</b> Giorgio Ascoli</p>
  	<p><b>Description:</b></p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">I would like to stimulate the conversation and the exchange of opinions on 
  	the following questions:</p>
  	<ol>
  	  <li>Why are there so many different morphological classes of neurons in nervous systems? Why is 
  	  there such a wide morphological variability even within given morphological classes? What is 
  	  the influence of dendritic morphology on neuronal electrophysiology and synaptic integration, 
  	  either qualitatively (e.g. spiking VS bursting) or quantitatively (e.g. spike frequency, 
  	  inter-train interval, etc.)?</li>
  	  <li>How does all of the above affect network connectivity? How do dendritic and axonal growth 
  	  interact with each others, and what role does this play on ensable activity and dynamics?</li>
  	  <li>How can we describe in a concise, effective, complete and yet intuitive way the 
  	  "fundamental" parameters of neuronal morphology and network anatomy? At what level a 
  	  biologically plausible network model should include the mutual interplay between neuroanatomy 
  	  and neurophysiology?</li>
  	  <li>In principle, what is the right approach to generate "virtual brains" in a computer? By 
  	  assembling large-scale experimental databases? By generating accurate stochastic models 
  	  constrained by experimental statistics? Or maybe an hybrid of these two approaches?</li>
  	</ol>

  	<p><b>Workshop Title:</b> Cortical Dynamics: Its Turtles From Here On Down</p>
  	<p><b>Moderator:</b> Phil Ulinski</p>
  	<p><b>Description:</b></p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">The nervous system of freshwater turtles makes an excellent preparation 
  	for neurobiological studies because these animals have a remarkable tolerance to anoxia. Turtle 
  	forebrains can, therefore, be maintained intact in an in vitro preparation and used in a variety 
  	of different kinds of studies. The goal for this minisymposium is to review recent work on the 
  	spatial and temporal dynamics of turtle visual cortex using an in vitro preparation of the turtle 
  	geniculocortical pathway. Philip Ulinski will discuss the use of turtle cortex for studies that 
  	relie upon intracellular recording techniques to test the key features of the canonical 
  	microcircuit concept formulated by Douglas, Martin and colleagues. David Senseman will discuss 
  	the use of turtle cortex for studies that use voltage sensitive dyes to characterize the 
  	spatiotemporal dynamics produced in the cortex by visual stimuli. Kay Robbins will discuss the 
  	use of dynamical systems methods to characterize the waves of activity produced in the cortex by 
  	visual stimuli. Bijoy Ghosh will describe a network model of turtle cortex, based on 
  	biophysically realistic models of individual neurons, which analyzes basic features of the waves 
  	of activity seen in voltage sensitive dye studies.</p>

  	<p><b>Workshop Title:</b> Map development in visual cortex</p>
  	<p><b>Moderator:</b> Geoff Goodhill</p>
  	<p><b>Description:</b></p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">Models for the development of maps in visual cortex have a long history. 
  	From a relatively small set of basic mathematical principles, an impressive amount of 
  	experimental data can be accounted for. However, experimental advances continually provide new 
  	challenges, and theoretical advances pose new and often surprising predictions. The goal of the 
  	workshop is to review the different theoretical approaches in this fast-moving field, see where 
  	they agree and where they disagree in their biological predictions, and to gain further 
  	understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different models.</p>

  	<p><b>Workshop Title:</b> Nonlinear dynamics and noise in single neurons and in human 
  	psychophysics experiments.</p>
  	<p><b>Moderators:</b> Hans Braun, Frank Moss</p>
  	<p><b>Description:</b></p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">Neurons with subthreshold, noise mediated oscillators in reality and in a 
  	Hodgkin-Huxley model will be discussed. The temperature dependence, electrosensitivity and 
  	pharmacological modulation, bifurcations and the signatures of noise mediated low dimensional 
  	dynamical behavior in electro-, photo-, cold-receptors and hypothalamic neurons of example real 
  	neurons are discussed. Topology of the dynamics in the zero noise Hodgkin-Huxley oscillating 
  	neuron model is examined. An explosion of time intervals that results from the collision of a 
  	fixed point with a homoclinic orbit, is observed at low temperatures in real pacemaker neurons 
  	and in the HH model. By numerical simulation of a Hodgkin-Huxley model with an intrinsic 
  	oscillator, we compare the dynamics of the spike trains with the trajectories of the system. 
  	Reconstructed dynamics on the Poincare section and measures are discussed.</p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">How computational neuroscience work led to animal studies that led to 
  	psychophysical studies that have now led to clinical studies. We demonstrate stochastic 
  	resonance-type behavior in: model neurons, rat cutaneous sensory neurons, and the human 
  	touch-sensation system. We discuss how, from a bioengineering and clinical standpoint, these 
  	developments may be particularly relevant for individuals with elevated sensory thresholds, such 
  	as older adults and patients with peripheral neuropathy.</p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">The electroreceptor in the paddlefish (Polyodon Spathula) contains a quite rigid internal 
  	oscillator. Though their frequencies do not respond sensitively to external fields we have found 
  	that they can easily be synchronized (phase locked). The effects can be accurately mimicked with 
  	a noisy Hodgkin-Huxley or circle map.</p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">Questions to be addressed:</p>
  	<ul>
  	  <li>Do nonlinear dynamical processes play a role in encoding, or do they just simply reflect 
  	  the stochastic nonlinear properties of these neurons?</li>
  	  <li>What is the source of "bursting" in the oscillating HH model, and could it be an 
  	  explanation for bursting in pacemaker-type neurons?</li>
  	  <li>Does the explosion of time intervals encode temperature information?</li>
  	  <li>Is the spike timing sufficient to describe the underlying dynamics of the nervous system 
  	  and what does the dynamics represent?</li>
  	  <li>Will noise enhanced sensory perception lead to new therapies for diseases of the nervous 
  	  system?</li>
  	  <li>Does the rigidity of the oscillator and the ease of phase synchronization mean that the 
  	  paddlefish uses a synchronization code to locate, track and find its planktonic prey?</li>
  	</ul>

  	<p><b>Workshop Title:</b> Modeling the hippocampus: Is this the right direction, time and place?</p>
  	<p><b>Moderators</b>: Phil Best and Ali Minai</p>
  	<p><b>Description</b>:</p>
  	
  	<p class="insprongpar">A number of models have been developed to account for neural processes 
  	underlying the characteristics of place cells in the hippocampus and head-direction cells in 
  	related structures. The workshop will provide an opportunity to discuss a variety of questions 
  	concerning the performance of these models in explaining experimental data, the problems inherent 
  	in hippocampal modeling, and possible future directions. Questions:</p>
  	<ol>
  	  <li>What is the state of the art in hippocampal models, and what are the most important 
  	  outstanding questions?</li>
  	  <li>How well do the existing models fit existing data?</li>
  	  <li>Are there any properties of place and head-direction cells that make modeling them 
  	  particularly difficult?</li>
  	  <li>Do any of the models make unintuitive predictions that have yet to be tested?</li>
  	  <li>Are there empirical questions yet to be addressed that would distinguish between the 
  	  models?</li>
  	  <li>What methods, technologies, and experimental paradigms are needed to address the most 
  	  important open questions in the field?</li>
  	</ol>
