  	<h2>The Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting</h2>

  	<h4>CNS*1999 Call for proposals</h4>
  	
  	<p><b>CNS*99 Workshop Announcement</b><br />
  	July 21 and 22, 1999</p>
  	
  	<p>Workshops on current topics in computational neuroscience will be held on July 21 and 22, 1999 
  	(the last 2 days of the CNS*99 conference, July 18-22, 1999) in Pittsburg, PA. Proposals for 
  	these workshops are solicited.</p>
  	
  	<p>There will be three types of workshop sessions:</p>
  	
  	<ul>
  	  <li>Formal Discussion Workshop sessions,</li>
  	  <li>Informal Discussion Workshop sessions and</li>
  	  <li>Informal Tutorial/Mini-symposium sessions.</li>
  	</ul>
  	
  	<p>The workshops are designed to provide an informal atmosphere for conference attendees to learn 
  	about a topic in depth or to discuss important issues in computational neuroscience. Interactive 
  	open discussions among participants are encouraged while keeping the presentations to a minimum. 
  	A general overview of the topics as well as alternative view points are encouraged in the 
  	discussions to foster cooperativity among researchers. The difference between formal and informal 
  	discussion workshops is that formal discussion workshops are held in a conference room, while 
  	informal discussion workshops are held in a non-traditional setting, such as in a park or by the 
  	pool.</p>
  	
  	<p>Responsibilities of workshop moderators include:</p>
  	
  	<ol>
  	  <li>writing a topic description for the proposed workshop;</li>
  	  <li>moderating the discussions during the workshop, and/or organizing presentations;</li>
  	  <li>writing a brief summary report of the high points of the discussions, and sending it to the 
  	  workshop coordinator for inclusion on the CNS*99 web site after the conference.</li>
  	</ol>
  	
  	<h4>Workshop Proposal Submission Instructions</h4>
  	
  	<p>Submit:</p>
  	
  	<ol>
  	  <li>the name(s) of the workshop moderator(s);</li>
  	  <li>the title of the workshop;</li>
  	  <li>a short description of the topic in the form of either a short abstract or a short list of 
  	  questions to be discussed;</li>
  	  <li>a short list of tentative presenters (for informal tutorial/mini-symposium workshop 
  	  sessions only);</li>
  	  <li>state whether it is a one-day or two-day workshop;</li>
  	  <li>specify whether it is an informal discussion workshop, a formal discussion workshop or an 
  	  informal tutorial/mini-symposium.</li>
  	</ol>
  	
  	<p>Organizers are encouraged to submit proposals to the workshop coordinator, Avrama Blackwell, 
  	prior to the CNS*99 conference to allow them to be posted on the CNS*99 web site. E-Mail your 
  	workshop submissions to Avrama Blackwell or check the CNS*99 web site for more information.</p>
