  	<h2>The Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting</h2>
  	
  	<h3>July 18-22, 1999, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</h3>
  	
  	<h4>CNS*1999 Instructions to Authors</h4>
  	
  	<h4>Proceedings Computational Neuroscience Meeting<br />
  	To be published as part of the Journal Neurocomputing</h4>
  	
  	
  	<p class="marginboven"><b>Deadline:</b> Papers due on or before October 15, 1999</p>
  	
  	<h4>General:</h4>
  	
  	<p>Please read these instructions carefully. Please note that the Guest Editor of the Proceedings 
  	will be collecting your work. If you have queries regarding technical details, you can however 
  	contact the Author Support Department at the Publisher.</p>
  	
  	<p>Your paper should be introduced by three to five keywords and a self-contained abstract of no 
  	more than 100 words not counting the formulas. Biosketch (limit yourself to 150 words) and photo 
  	(passport size) of each author should be supplied as well. For the conference proceedings a limit 
  	of six typeset pages is valid. The conversion factor is roughly 25 - 30 %; i.e. a manuscript of 8 
  	pages printed on one side in double spacing with wide margins (3cm) generates approximately 6 
  	pages.</p>
  	
  	<p>Footnotes should be avoided if possible and be brief. They should be numbered consecutively. 
  	Please make sure that the paper is submitted in its final form. Corrections in the proof stage 
  	other than printer's errors should be avoided: costs arising from such corrections will be 
  	charged to the authors.</p>
  	
  	<p>An accepted article can be submitted in electronic form (a LaTeX file, or as a file from other 
  	word processors), but should always be accompanied by a paper manuscript (typed on one side in 
  	double spacing with wide margins). Only the final accepted manuscript can be submitted on disk, 
  	along with a paper-printed version that is identical to the file. Please label the disk with your 
  	name, and mention which word processor you have used.</p>
  	
  	<p>Please note that your submission, or any translation of it, should not have copyrighted or 
  	published or is not being submitted for publication elsewhere.</p>
  	
  	<p>Upon acceptance of an article, the author(s) will be asked to transfer copyright of the 
  	article to the Publisher. This transfer will ensure the widest possible dissemination of 
  	information.</p>
  	
  	<h4>References:</h4>
  	
  	<p>References should be listed alphabetically, as in the following examples:<br />
  	Books (1), articles in journals (2), papers in a contributed volume (3, 4), unpublished papers 
  	(5).</p>

  	  University of Maryland, 1989</li>
  	</ul>
  	
  	<h4>Figures:</h4>
  	
  	<p>If you are considering the submission of your manuscript as an electronic file, you may wonder 
  	whether we would also like to have an electronic version of the illustrations. The answer is yes! 
  	Although there are still a large number of technical difficulties to overcome, we are processing 
  	graphic files in a growing number of cases. Both scanned and computer generated illustrations, 
  	either color or black and white are acceptable. (Notes: for color we charge!)<br />
  	The following requirements are to be met:</p>
  	
  	<ul>
  	  <li>Hard copy in all cases.</li>
  	  <li>Since we cannot a priori guarantee the usability of your graphic file(s) hard-copies of all 
  	  illustrations should accompany the accepted printout of the manuscript of all cases. One set 
  	  should be in publishable condition.</li>
  	</ul>
  	
  	<h4>Diskette:</h4>
  	
  	<p>Files should preferably be submitted on diskette, either IBM or Macintosh. Submission via 
  	e-mail is not recommended.</p>
  	
  	<h4>Format:</h4>
  	
  	<p>TIFF or EPS files are preferred. TIFF files should preferably be compressed, but only LZW 
  	(Macintosh) compression is acceptable. Please note that corrections in EPS figures are only 
  	possible if they have been prepared with Adobe Illustrator 3.0 or higher versions. The usability 
  	of other formats is to a large extent dependent on the information you supply us with concerning 
  	the soft-and hardware used. It is a good idea to put the relevant information in the header of 
  	the file.</p>
  	
  	<h4>Resolution:</h4>
  	
  	<p>Drawings made with Adobe Illustrator and Aldus Freehand (Macintosh) and CorelDraw (IBM/DOS) 
  	generally give good results. Drawings made in WordPerfect or Word generally have too low a 
  	resolution; only if made at a much higher resolution (1016 dpi) can they be used. Files of 
  	scanned line drawings are acceptable if done at a minimum of 1016 dpi. For scanned halftone 
  	figures a resolution of 300 dpi is sufficient. Scanned figures compressed with JPEG usually give 
  	no problems. Please note that scanned figures cannot be enlarged, only reduced.</p>
  	
  	
  	<h4>Electronic Submissions: LaTeX</h4>
  	
  	<p>LaTeX files of papers that have been accepted for publication may be sent to the Publisher by 
  	e-mail or on a diskette (3.5" or 5.25" MS-DOS). If the file is suitable, proofs will be produced 
  	without rekeying the text. The article should be encoded in ESP-LaTeX, standard LaTeX, or 
  	AMS-LaTeX (in document style "article"). The Elsevier-LaTeX package, together with instructions 
  	on how to prepare a file, is available from the Publisher. This package (including detailed 
  	information for LaTeX preparation) can be obtained from the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network 
  	(CTAN). Search for Elsevier on the CTAN Search page or the CTAN-Web page or use direct access via 
  	FTP in Germany, United Kingdom or (Massachusetts, USA) and go to the directory: 
  	(/texarchive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/elsevier).</p>
  	
  	<p>The Elsevier package consists of the files; ascii.tab (ASCII table), elsart.cls (use this file 
  	if you are using LaTeX2e, the current version of LaTeX), elsart.sty and elsart12.sty (use these 
  	two files if you are using LaTeX2.09, the previous version of LaTeX), instraut.dvi and/or 
  	instraut.ps (instruction booklet), readme. CTAN is a mirrored network of 
  	<a href="ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk">ftp.tex.ac.uk</a>, <a href="ftp://ftp.dante.de">ftp.dante.de</a> 
  	and tug2.cs.umb.edu, which are widely mirrored and hold up-to-date copies of all the 
  	public-domain versions of TeX, LaTeX, Metafont and ancillary programs.</p>
  	
  	<p>No changes from the accepted version are permissible, without the explicit approval by the 
  	Editors. The Publisher reserves the right to decide whether to use the author's file or not.
  	Authors should include an ASCII table (available from the Publisher) in their files to enable the 
  	detection of transmission errors. The files should be mailed to Elvira Nieuwerf, Elsevier Science 
  	BV, PO Box 2759, 1000 CT Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Fax: +31 20 485 3264. NOTE: in the case of 
  	the Proceedings, only send material directly to the Publisher after the Guest Editor has approved 
  	of this. For the purpose of further correspondence the manuscript should end with a complete 
  	mailing address, preferably including e-mail address, of at least one to the authors.</p>
  	
  	<h4>Electronic submission: Non-LaTeX</h4>
  	
  	<p>The word-processed text should be in single column format. Keep the layout of the text as 
  	simple as possible; in particular, do not use the word-processor's options to justify the text or 
  	to hyphenate the words. The electronic text should be prepared in a way very similar to that of 
  	conventional manuscripts. The list of references, figures and tables in the text; instead, 
  	indicate their approximate locations, either directly in the electronic text or on the 
  	manuscript.</p>
  	
  	<p>The final text should be submitted both in manuscript form and on diskette. Use standard 3.5" 
  	or 5.25" diskettes for this purpose. Both double density (DD) and high-density (HD) diskettes are 
  	acceptable. It is recommended to tear the main text, list of references, tables and figure 
  	legends in separate text files with clearly identifiable file names (for example, with extensions 
  	.TXT, .REF, .TBL, .FIG).</p>
  	
  	<p>Essential is that name and version of the work-processing program and type of computer on 
  	which the text was prepared is clearly indicated on the diskette label or the accompanying 
  	checklist. The manuscript may contain parts (e.g. formulas or complex tables) or last-minute 
  	corrections which are not included in the text on diskette; however, if this is the case then 
  	differences with the diskette version should be clearly marked on the manuscript.</p>
  	
  	<p>Please send the papers on or before October 15, 1999 to:<br />
  	Caltech<br />
  	Division of Biology, 216-76<br />
  	1200 E. California Blvd.<br />
  	Pasadena, CA 91125<br />
