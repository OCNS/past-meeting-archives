  	<h2>The Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting</h2>
  	
  	<h3>July 18-22, 1999, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</h3>
  	
  	<h4>CNS*1999 General Information</h4>
  	
  	<p>CNS*99 will be held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, July 18-22, 1999, and is sponsored in part by 
  	the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of 
  	Pittsburgh.</p>
  	
  	<p>This is the eighth in a series of annual inter-disciplinary conferences intended to address 
  	the broad range of research approaches and issues involved in the general field of computational 
  	neuroscience.</p>
  	
  	<p>As in the previous years, this meeting will bring together experimental and theoretical 
  	neurobiologists along with engineers, computer scientists, cognitive scientists, physicists, and 
  	mathematicians interested in understanding how biological neural systems compute. The meeting 
  	will equally emphasize experimental, model-based, and more abstract theoretical approaches to 
  	understanding neurobiological computation.</p>
