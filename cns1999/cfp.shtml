  	<p>With this announcement we solicit the submission of presented papers, all of which will be 
  	refereed. Peer review will be conducted based on a 1000-word (or less) summary describing the 
  	methods, nature, and importance of your results. Authors will be notified of acceptance by the 
  	second week of May, 1999.</p>
  	
  	<p>As for last year's meeting, all submission of papers will be performed electronically using a 
  	custom-designed Web interface. Full instructions for submission can be found at the meeting web 
  	site.</p>
  	
  	<p>However, in brief, authors should cut and paste text from their own word processors into the 
  	forms available on the web site. It is important that all requested information be provided, 
  	including a 100 word abstract for publication in the conference program, all author information, 
  	and selection of the appropriate category and theme from the list provided. Authors should 
  	especially note the mechanisms used for figures and mathematical equations. All submissions will 
  	be acknowledged by e-mail within 48 hours. Program committee decisions will be sent to the 
  	designated correspondence author only. Submissions will not be considered if they lack category 
  	information, abstracts, author addresses, or are late.</p>
  	
  	<p>We would like to strongly encourage authors to make their submissions electronically. However, 
  	if you do not have ready access to the internet or a web server, we will send you instructions 
  	for paper submission if you contact us either by e-mail or at the following address.</p>
