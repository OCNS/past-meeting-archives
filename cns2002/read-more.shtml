  	<h2>The Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting</h2>
  	
  	<h3>July 21-25 2002, Chicago, Illinois, USA</h3>
  	
  	<p class="marginboven">The Computational Neuroscience meeting is a yearly interdisciplinary 
  	conference organized around the broad range of research approaches and issues involved in 
  	understanding the function of nervous systems. Starting in 1992 these meetings have brought 
  	together experimental and theoretical neurobiologists along with engineers, computer scientists, 
  	cognitive scientists, physicists, and mathematicians interested in understanding the relationship 
  	between the structure and function of mammalian and non-mammalian nervous systems. Research 
  	papers are solicited and peer reviewed prior to the meeting and then presented in either poster 
  	or oral format. Each year meeting participants also nominate a small number of invited speakers 
  	for the following year. Each year a proceedings volume has also been published. The CNS meeting 
  	equally emphasize experimental, model-based, and more abstract theoretical approaches to 
  	understanding neurobiological computation.</p>
  	
  	<h4>This Year's Meeting</h4>
  	
  	<p>This is the eleventh in a series of annual inter-disciplinary conferences intended to address 
  	the broad range of research approaches and issues involved in the general field of computational 
  	neuroscience. As in the previous years, this meeting will bring together experimental and 
  	theoretical neurobiologists along with engineers, computer scientists, cognitive scientists, 
  	physicists, and mathematicians interested in understanding how biological neural systems compute. 
  	The meeting will equally emphasize experimental, model-based, and theoretical approaches to 
  	understanding neurobiological computation. All accepted papers must demonstrate a clear and 
  	direct relationship to biological neural computation.</p>
  	
  	<h4>Posters</h4>
  	
  	<p>The poster boards are 4 feet x 8 feet (1.2 meters x 2.4 meters).</p>
