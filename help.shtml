  Notice: New paper submission procedure!<BR>
</font><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA,HELV" COLOR="#464646">
As in the years before papers presented at the CNS*04 meeting can be 
  published as a paper in a special issue of the journal Neurocomputing. Authors who would like to see their 
  CNS*04 presentation published have to submit a <B>complete</B> paper for 
  review now.  You also have the option to instead submit an extended 
  summary but this cannot be included in the journal.  Both types of 
  submissions will be reviewed but full manuscripts will get back 
  reviewers' comments and will have to be revised with final submission 
  shortly after the meeting. The decision of who gets to speak at the 
  conference is independent of the type of submission, both full papers 
  and extended summaries qualify. More details on the review process 
  can be found below.

<H4>Paper submission</H4>
</FONT><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA,HELV" COLOR="#464646">
<u>Submission is done on 2 web pages:</u><BR>
  A first page which asks for general info on your paper including the 
  abstract (as text), press <B>Submit</B> when you are done.<BR>
  A second page which allows you to specify the pdf file containing 
  your full paper or extended summary. Prepare the paper or extended summary as a pdf file. <FONT COLOR="RED">The pdf file contains max 6 typeset pages or 
max 10 double-space pages plus max 4 illustrations and have a filename of 
max 32 characters without blanks</FONT>. Press <B>Submit</B> when you 
  are done. You will receive a page telling you whether the file was 
  successfully uploaded.
<P>
  <u>You can submit multiple papers:</u><br> 
After you completed submission of the 
  first paper (see above) you follow the link "Go back to my first record";
 go to the bottom and press <B>Add new record</B> to create a 
  (blank) record for the next paper. Provide the required information 
  on 2 pages as before (press <B>Submit</B> twice). When you return to the 
  paper submission form you can see on the top of the form how many 
  papers you have uploaded and use <B>Show Prev/Next record</B> buttons at the 
  bottom to scroll trough your records.</P>

<P><u>You can withdraw a paper:</u><br>
  Select the <B>Withdraw</B> option <B>followed by a Submit</B> if you want  to 
  withdraw the current paper (we will remove the record before the 
  review process).</P>

<H4>The review process</H4>
</FONT><FONT FACE="ARIAL,HELVETICA,HELV" COLOR="#464646">
All submitted papers will be first reviewed by the program committee. 
  Papers will be judged and accepted for the meeting based on the 
  clarity with which the work is described and the biological relevance 
  of the research.  For this reason authors should be careful to make 
  the connection to biology clear.  We reject only a small fraction of 
  the papers (~ 5%) and this usually based on absence of biological 
  relevance (e.g. pure machine learning). We will notify authors of 
  meeting acceptance before begin March.

  The second stage of review involves evaluation by two independent 
  reviewers of full papers submitted to the journal Neurocomputing 
  (all) and those extended summaries which requested an oral 
  presentation.

  Full papers will be reviewed as real journal publications: each paper 
  will have an action editor and two independent reviewers. The paper 
  may be rejected for publication if it contains no novel content or is 
  considered to contain grave errors.  We hope that this will apply to 
  a small number of papers only but we also need to respect a limit of 
  maximum 200 published papers which may enforce more strict criteria. 
  Paper rejection at this stage does not exclude poster presentation at 
  the meeting itself as we assume that these authors will benefit from 
  the feedback they can receive at the meeting. Accepted papers will 
  receive comments for improvements and corrections from the reviewers. 
  Submissions of the revised papers will be due in August.

  Criteria for selection as an oral presentation include perceived 
  quality, the novelty of the research and the diversity and coherence 
  of the overall program.  To ensure diversity, those who have given 
  talks in the recent past will not be selected and multiple oral 
  presentations from the same lab will be discouraged. All accepted 
  papers not selected for oral talks as well as papers explicitly 
  submitted as poster presentations will be included in one of three 
  evening poster sessions.  Authors will be notified of the 
  presentation format of their papers by begin of May.

The proceedings volume is published each year as a special supplement 
  to the journal Neurocomputing. Only 200 papers 
  will be published in the proceedings volume. For reference, papers 
  presented at CNS*02 can be found in volumes 52-54  of Neurocomputing 
  (2003).
