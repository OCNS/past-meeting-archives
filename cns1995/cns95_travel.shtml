  	<h2>The Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting</h2>
  	
  	<h3>July 11 - 15, 1995, Monterey, California</h3>
  	
  	<h4>CNS*1995 Travel, Food and Lodging Logistics</h4>
  	
  	<p>The CNS 95 Meeting site is the <b>Doubletree Hotel at Fisherman's Wharf</b> in Monterey. This 
  	is THE PREMIER resort/conference hotel in Monterey. The hotel is built around a walking mall and 
  	plaza surrounded by several historic buildings (including the old customs house) and a beautiful 
  	regional museum. This plaza is situated at the dead-end of old Alvarado street where it runs into 
  	Monterey Bay (right at the entrance to Fisherman's Wharf, where there are many fine, inexpensive 
  	seafood restaurants.) Local attractions include windsurfing, kayaking, and snorkeling. For those 
  	wishing to stay dry, a beautiful bayside (paved) path extends for several miles in both 
  	directions up and down the coast from the hotel, perfect for walking, biking, skating or running. 
  	Skates and bikes are available for rental at reasonable rates. The famous "Cannery Row" section 
  	of town, including the spectacular Aquarium, is 5-minutes away by rollerblade along this path. 
  	Other local attractions requiring a short car trip include visits to Carmel, the Carmel Mission, 
  	the Seventeen Mile Drive, and several very beautiful beach parks. The area is also known for its 
  	19 champion golf courses. Charter fishing is available from the doorstep of the hotel. The hotel 
  	has a swimming pool, Jacuzzi and "spa room" available for all guests.</p>
  	
  	<h4>HOTEL RATES:</h4>
  	
  	<p><b>IN ORDER TO GET THESE RATES YOU MUST MAKE YOUR RESERVATION BEFORE JUNE 12th, 1995!!</b></p>
  	
  	<p>The Hotel management has been extremely generous in giving us highly discounted rates for 
  	their rooms during their peak tourist season. Details are as follows:</p>
  	
  	<p><em>ALL RATES ARE "ROOM" RATES AND ALL ROOMS CAN HAVE TWO PEOPLE (thus if you are sharing a 
  	room you may only end up paying half)</em></p>
  	
  	<ul>
  	  <li>student attendees: <b>$ 99</b> PER ROOM PER DAY</li>
  	  <li>non-student attendees: <b>$122</b> PER ROOM PER DAY</li>
  	  <li>Government attendees: <b>$ 82</b> PER (SINGLE) ROOM PER DAY<br />
  	  <b>$102</b> PER (DOUBLE) ROOM PER DAY</li>
  	</ul>
  	
  	<p>[ note that there is only a block of 10 ]<br />
  	[ government rate rooms -- you must work ]<br />
  	[ for someone like NIH or NSF to get this rate ]</p>
  	
  	<p>In all cases, extra "cots" can be put in the rooms, if you want to save even more money... 
  	There is a $20 charge for each extra person above 2. CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 18 ARE FREE!</p>
  	
  	<h4>MAKE YOUR OWN HOTEL RESERVATIONS:</h4>
  	
  	<p>You must make your reservations directly with the hotel, and guarantee them with a credit 
  	card. YOU MUST IDENTIFY YOUR AFFILIATION WITH THE MEETING TO GET THE SPECIAL RATES!!!!!</p>
  	
  	<p>The conference is Tuesday JULY 12th THROUGH Saturday July 15th. We suggest that you book a 
  	room from the evening of Monday, July 10th though the evening of Friday July 14th inclusive, or 
  	stay over Saturday night July 15th after the conference ends.</p>
