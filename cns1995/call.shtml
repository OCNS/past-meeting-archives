  	<h2>The Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting</h2>
  	
  	<h3>July 11 - 15, 1995, Monterey, California</h3>
  	
  	<h4>CNS*1995 Call for Papers</h4>
  	
  	<p>This is the fourth annual meeting of an interdisciplinary conference intended to address the 
  	broad range of research approaches and issues involved in the field of computational 
  	neuroscience. The last three annual meetings, in San Francisco (CNS*92), Washington, DC (CNS*93), 
  	and Monterey, California (CNS*94) brought experimental and theoretical neurobiologists along 
  	with engineers, computer scientists, cognitive scientists, physicists, and mathematicians 
  	together to consider the functioning of biological nervous systems. Peer reviewed papers were 
  	presented on a range of subjects related to understanding how nervous systems compute.</p>
  	
  	<p>As in previous years, the meeting will equally emphasize experimental, model-based, and more 
  	abstract theoretical approaches to understanding neurobiological computation. The meeting in 1995 
  	will again take place at the Monterey Doubletree Hotel and include plenary, contributed and 
  	poster sessions. There will be no parallel sessions and the full text of presented papers will be 
  	published in a proceedings volume. The last day of the meeting will be devoted to a series of 
  	informal workshops focused on current issues in computational neuroscience.</p>
  	
  	<p>With this announcement we solicit the submission of presented papers. All papers will be 
  	refereed. Authors should send original research contributions in the form of a 1000-word (or 
  	less) summary and a separate single page 50-100 word abstract clearly stating their results. 
  	Summaries are for program committee use only. Abstracts will be published in the conference 
  	program. At the bottom of each abstract page and on the first summary page, indicate preference 
  	for oral or poster presentation and specify at least one appropriate category and theme from the 
  	following list:</p>
