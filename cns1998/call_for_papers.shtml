  	<h2>The Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting</h2>
  	
  	<h3>July 26 - 30, 1998 Santa Barbara, California</h3>
  	
  	<h4>CNS*1998 Call for Papers</h4>
  	
  	<p>This is the seventh annual meeting of an interdisciplinary conference addressing a broad range 
  	of research approaches and issues involved in the field of computational neuroscience. These 
  	meetings bring together experimental and theoretical neurobiologists along with engineers, 
  	computer scientists, cognitive scientists, physicists, and mathematicians interested in the 
  	functioning of biological nervous systems. Peer reviewed papers are presented all related to 
  	understanding how nervous systems compute. As in previous years, CNS*98 will equally emphasize 
  	experimental, model-based, and more abstract theoretical approaches to understanding 
  	neurobiological computation. This is the seventh annual meeting of an interdisciplinary

  	<p>The meeting in 1998 will take place at the Fess Parker's Double Tree Resort in Santa Barbara, 
  	California, and include plenary, contributed, and poster sessions. The first session starts at 9 
  	am, Sunday, July 26th and ends with the annual banquet on Thursday evening, July 30th. There will 
  	be no parallel sessions. The meeting will include time for informal workshops focused on current 
  	issues in computational neuroscience. Travel funds will be available for students and 
  	postdoctoral fellows presenting papers. Child day care will also be available.</p>
  	
  	<p>Santa Barbara, California is approximately 1-1/2 hours by car from the Los Angeles 
  	International airport (LAX). Airport shuttles from the airport to Santa Barbara run regularly. In 
  	addition, Santa Barbara has its own small airport. The hotel itself is located on the ocean and 
  	within walking distance from distinctive downtown Santa Barbara.</p>
  	
  	<p>With this announcement we solicit the submission of presented papers. All papers will be 
  	refereed. Peer review will be conducted based on a 1000-word (or less) summary describing the 
  	methods, nature, and importance of your results. Authors will be notified of acceptance by the 
  	second week of May, 1998.</p>
  	
  	<h4>Submission Instructions</h4>
  	
  	<p>This year, for the first, time, submission of papers will be performed electronically using a 
  	custom designed JAVA/HTML interface. Full instructions for submission can be found at the 
  	meeting's submission page.</p>
  	
  	<p>In brief, authors should cut and paste text from their own word processors into the forms 
  	available on the web site. It is important that all requested information be provided, including 
  	a 100 word abstract for publication in the conference program, all author information, and 
  	selection of the appropriate category and theme from the list provided. Authors should especially 
  	note the mechanisms used for handling figures and mathematical equations. All submissions will be 
  	acknowledged immediately by email. Program committee decisions will be sent to the designated 
  	correspondence author only. Submissions will not be considered if they lack category information, 
  	abstracts, author addresses, or are late.</p>
