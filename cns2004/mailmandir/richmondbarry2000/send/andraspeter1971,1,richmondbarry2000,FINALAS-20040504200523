Template accept with revisions

Dear Peter Andras,

We're happy to inform you that your paper 'Neural activity pattern systems' may be accepted for
publication in the CNS proceedings provided the required revisions are
made and you present your paper at the CNS*04 meeting.

Instructions for the revisions can be found below.  Please note
that you get only one chance to resubmit, if the Action Editor barry richmond
deems that the revisions are insufficient the paper may be rejected
without appeal.  We therefore encourage you to contact the Action
Editor by e-mail soon if you have any questions or concerns about the
required revisions.

The revised paper and a short description of changes made can be
uploaded at http://www.neuroinf.org between July 1 and August 22.  The
Action Editor will decide within one month of paper submission.  You
will receive a separate e-mail with instructions on how to upload
revised papers in June.  The CNS proceedings will appear as a special
issue of the journal Neurocomputing.

Don't forget to register for the meeting at http://www.cnsorg.org
If you requested an oral presentation: we're still finalizing the review process of other papers.  You can expect a decision early May. 


Best regards,


barry richmond and Erik De Schutter

INSTRUCTIONS FOR REVISIONS

Reviewer 1 :
The paper describes superficially a very complicated framework. As it is, readers will find it impenetrable.

I believe equation (6) is in error. Using set notation, the numerator on the right is Pr[B and A1+A2+...+An] (Here + means union) and the denominator is Pr[A1+A2+...+An] (assuming reference sets are mutually exclusive). The ratio of these two is a conditional probability, not an unconditional one. Is this what you mean?

It would be much more interesting to show the neural applications.
