Dear Joe Graham,

We're happy to inform you that your paper 'Modeling Motoneurons after Spinal Cord Injury  Persistent Inward Currents and Plateau Potentials' has been accepted
for publication in the CNS proceedings.

You have now two options: either we publish the paper as it was
submitted in January or you may make MINOR revisions based on, for
example, feedback you receive during the meeting.  In the first case
you should do nothing.  In the second case you will be able to upload
the revised paper and a short description of changes made at
http://www.neuroinf.org between July 1 and August 22.  You will receive
a separate e-mail with instructions on how to upload revised papers in
June.  The CNS proceedings will appear as a special issue of the
journal Neurocomputing.

Don't forget to register for the meeting at http://www.cnsorg.org
If you requested an oral presentation: we're still finalizing the review process of other papers.  You can expect a decision early May. 

Best regards,


Frances Skinner and Erik De Schutter
