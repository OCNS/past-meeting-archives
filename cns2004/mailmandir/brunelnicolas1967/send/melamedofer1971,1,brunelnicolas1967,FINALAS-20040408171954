Template accept with revisions

Dear ofer melamed,

We're happy to inform you that your paper 'Subthreshold cross-correlations between cortical neurons 
A reference model with static synapses' may be accepted for
publication in the CNS proceedings provided the required revisions are
made.  Instructions for the revisions can be found below.  Please note
that you get only one chance to resubmit, if the Action Editor Nicolas Brunel
deems that the revisions are insufficient the paper may be rejected
without appeal.  We therefore encourage you to contact the Action
Editor by e-mail soon if you have any questions or concerns about the
required revisions.

The revised paper and a short description of changes made can be
uploaded at http://www.neuroinf.org between July 1 and August 22.  The
Action Editor will decide within one month of paper submission.  You
will receive a separate e-mail with instructions on how to upload
revised papers in June.  The CNS proceedings will appear as a special
issue of the journal Neurocomputing.

Don't forget to register for the meeting at http://www.cnsorg.org

Best regards,


Nicolas Brunel and Erik De Schutter

INSTRUCTIONS FOR REVISIONS

Reviewer 1 :
This is nice work on a very interesting topic.
Comments 
1. The paper does not give a reference to Fig. 1. The legend is not clear either  does this figure refer to experimental data or to simulations ?
2. It is hard to see how the different parameters in the model affect the final result. Presumably the authors are sure that the negative conclusion is NOT a consequence of wrong choices of the parameter values. However, that does not become clear from the paper to the reader.
