Template accept with revisions

Dear Anat Elhalal,

We're happy to inform you that your paper 'In-vitro neuronal networks  evidence for synaptic plasticity' may be accepted for
publication in the CNS proceedings provided the required revisions are
made.  Instructions for the revisions can be found below.  Please note
that you get only one chance to resubmit, if the Action Editor Nicolas Brunel
deems that the revisions are insufficient the paper may be rejected
without appeal.  We therefore encourage you to contact the Action
Editor by e-mail soon if you have any questions or concerns about the
required revisions.

The revised paper and a short description of changes made can be
uploaded at http://www.neuroinf.org between July 1 and August 22.  The
Action Editor will decide within one month of paper submission.  You
will receive a separate e-mail with instructions on how to upload
revised papers in June.  The CNS proceedings will appear as a special
issue of the journal Neurocomputing.

Don't forget to register for the meeting at http://www.cnsorg.org

Best regards,


Nicolas Brunel and Erik De Schutter

INSTRUCTIONS FOR REVISIONS

Reviewer 1 :


Reviewer 2 :
The authors hypothetize that a transition in time from a stripe-like structure to a less organized struture exhibited by data is related to a development of correlations in the neuron activity due to synaptic plasticity at the network level.Most of the work emphasizes the appearance (or disappearance) of those stripes, even though the authors say that the development of correlations can be study directly. The experiment from where the data had been collected should be briefly described.
