Dear Xiao-Jing,

Concerning the paper : Parametric study of dopaminergic neuromodulatory  effect in a reduced model of the prefrontal cortex.
From : Koki Yamashita.

Nicolas Brunel would like to invite you to review the paper referenced above which has been submitted to the CNS*04 meeting which be held in Baltimore this summer (http://www.cnsorg.org). If you accept this invitation we expect you to complete your review within 3 weeks.

You will find instructions on how to react to this e-mail at the bottom of the message, please let us know asap whether you accept or decline to review this paper.  The neuroinf server will send you reminder e-mails if you do not react.

The authors have requested that their paper will be included in the conference proceedings to be published in the journal Neurocomputing (http://authors.elsevier.com/JournalDetail.html?PubID=505628&Precis=DESC).  Therefore (and this is new in 2004) you are asked to review this as a regular journal manuscript.  Most important are your suggestions for revisions if needed (use the Author Comment field). You also score for proceedings papers for Quality, Originality and Correctness.   Originality and Correctness are the most important ones as bad scores for either are formal criteria for rejection of the paper for publication.  Note that we plan to reject a minority of papers only and will allow authors to present their work as a poster even if the paper is rejected for publication (papers have already been screened by the Action Editor for appropriateness to the meeting).   
There will not be any re-review.

Finally, don't forget to press submit when you have finished your review!

Thank you for helping us to put together a high quality CNS meeting.

Best regards,


Nicolas Brunel (action editor) and Erik De Schutter (program chair)
