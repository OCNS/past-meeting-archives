Template accept with revisions

Dear Bjoern Naundorf,

We're happy to inform you that your paper 'Dynamical Response Properties of a Canonical Model for Type-I Membranes ' may be accepted for
publication in the CNS proceedings provided the required revisions are
made.  Instructions for the revisions can be found below.  Please note
that you get only one chance to resubmit, if the Action Editor Nicolas Brunel
deems that the revisions are insufficient the paper may be rejected
without appeal.  We therefore encourage you to contact the Action
Editor by e-mail soon if you have any questions or concerns about the
required revisions.

The revised paper and a short description of changes made can be
uploaded at http://www.neuroinf.org between July 1 and August 22.  The
Action Editor will decide within one month of paper submission.  You
will receive a separate e-mail with instructions on how to upload
revised papers in June.  The CNS proceedings will appear as a special
issue of the journal Neurocomputing.

Don't forget to register for the meeting at http://www.cnsorg.org

Best regards,


Nicolas Brunel and Erik De Schutter

INSTRUCTIONS FOR REVISIONS

Reviewer 1 :
In a recent paper (Fourcaud et al., J. Neurosci, 2003, 11628) Fourcaud et al.studied the spiking response to oscillating inputs for a variety of models with increasing realism. The results obtained in the present study are in agreement with Fourcaud et al paper which should be quoted. 

In their simulations Fourcaud et al. found that the Wang Buszaki model and the Quadratic Integrate and Fire model behave differently. This is in contrast with the conclusions of the present paper. The origin of the discrepancy should be discussed.

Reviewer 2 :
P.3 2. par. "To meet a realistic relaxation time of the MP ..."  what
is meant by relaxation time (the After Hyperpolarization)?  Give also
more details why I_0=0 and sigma=10^-3 (and not a line in parameter
space, e.g. sigma(I_0)) is a "reasonable choice".

Eq.(3) In the diffusion term of the Fokker-Planck eq.  is  
the factor \tau correct?

P.4, 1. par. What are the H_m(...), Hermite Polynomials? 
If so, this should be stated.

Sec. IV  How were the different values of the stat. firing rate
realized, by varying I_0, \sigma, or both? Give these parameter values
and not only the resulting rate v_0. It is said that the amplitude
exhibits a resonance maximum at v_0; later on the authors claim that
for realistic correlation times the resonance frequency is "well below
v_0". This is confusing.  Furthermore, is \tau_corr identical to the
correlation time \tau_c of the correlated stimulus as suggested by
Fig. 4 and the discussion on p.5? Or is it defined by the eigenvalue
\lambda_2 as stated in the text and thus a characteristic property of
the stimulated neuron?

Fig.3 Lines are hardly to distinguish. It is also not clear
which of the FOUR frequencies given in the legend belongs to
which of the THREE curves. Use labels or different line styles. 

Fig.4 (right panel) Give parameter values used for the simulation of
all the models.
