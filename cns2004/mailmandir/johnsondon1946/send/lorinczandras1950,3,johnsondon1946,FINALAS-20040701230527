Dear Andras Lorincz,

We inform you that your paper 'Finding structure by entropy minimization in coupled reconstruction networks' has been rejected for a proceedings paper. Your paper can be presented during the conference, but the reviewers felt it was not yet ready for juornal publication.

Best regards,


Don Johnson and Erik De Schutter
