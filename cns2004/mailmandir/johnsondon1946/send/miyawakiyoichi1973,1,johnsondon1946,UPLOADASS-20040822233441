Dear Yoichi Miyawaki,

We're happy to inform you that your paper 'Mechanisms of spike inhibition in a cortical network induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation' has been accepted for publication in the CNS proceedings.  The CNS proceedings will appear as a special issue of the journal Neurocomputing.

Best regards,


Don Johnson and Erik De Schutter
