Template accept with revisions

Dear Douglas Baxter,

We're happy to inform you that your paper 'Estimation of Single-Neuron Model Parameters from Spike Train Data' may be accepted for
publication in the CNS proceedings provided the required revisions are
made.  Instructions for the revisions can be found below.  Please note
that you get only one chance to resubmit, if the Action Editor Don Johnson
deems that the revisions are insufficient the paper may be rejected
without appeal.  We therefore encourage you to contact the Action
Editor by e-mail soon if you have any questions or concerns about the
required revisions.

The revised paper and a short description of changes made can be
uploaded at http://www.neuroinf.org between July 1 and August 22.  The
Action Editor will decide within one month of paper submission.  You
will receive a separate e-mail with instructions on how to upload
revised papers in June.  The CNS proceedings will appear as a special
issue of the journal Neurocomputing.

Don't forget to register for the meeting at http://www.cnsorg.org

Best regards,


Don Johnson and Erik De Schutter

INSTRUCTIONS FOR REVISIONS

Reviewer 1 :


Reviewer 2 :
The authors remark about the common problem of local minima.  Some recent work by Paninski and Pillow (maybe Neural Computation) shows that local minima are not a problem for reconstuction using a restricted class of models to reproduce spike train data.

minor commnets 
1. strange notation in Eqn 3   please define flag and the strange dummy variables in the double integral
2. pg 4  "place clamped" 
3. pg 5 ... are you sure 6.8 deg C not 6.3deg C?
