Dear #FNAME# #LNAME#,

We are sorry to inform you that your paper '#TITLE#' has been rejected
for publication in the CNS proceedings.

The reason for rejection is that the resubmitted paper is identical to the original version, and none of the reviewers comments were addressed.  Judging from the comments and the original manuscript, it could be a good paper, so we urge you to try submitting it elsewhere after attending to the comments.  We are sorry but there is no chance to resubmit the paper to these proceedings, as was specified in the original letter we sent to you.

Best regards,


#EDITOR# and Erik De Schutter
