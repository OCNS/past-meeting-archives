  	<h2>The Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting</h2>
  	
  	<h3>July 5-9, 2003, Alicante, Spain</h3>
  	
  	<h4>CNS*2003 Map of local area and transportation info</h4>
  	
  	<p>The conference will be hosted at two different venues around the harbor of Alicante. Oral 
  	sessions in the morning and evening will occur at the "Caja de Ahorros del Mediterráneo" (CAM) 
  	Auditorium ("Aula de Cultura de la CAM") in the intersection of "Parque de Canalejas" and 
  	"Avenida Doctor Gadea" (see D in the map). The entrance is at 1, Avenida Dr. Gadea. The 
  	conference will start in this place on July 5 at 9:45 am. The poster sessions will be hosted in 
  	the room "sala Europa" on July 5, and in the room "sala Alicante" on July 6 and 7 of the hotel 
  	Meliá, a 5 minute walk from the CAM Auditorium (see no. 2 in the map).</p>
  	
  	<h4>Airport transportation:</h4>
  	
  	<p>A taxi ride from the airport to the city center costs 12-15 euros. There is also public bus 
  	service connecting the airport to the city and serving all CNS*03 hotels: as you exit the airport 
  	terminal walk across the street and up the stairs to an upper level street, there you can take 
  	the bus C-6 leaving the airport everyday at irregular times 
  	(<a href="http://www.subus.es/Lineas/Ficheros/ALCC6HorarioDiario.asp?codigo=272">
  	see schedule "Salidas desde Aeropuerto"</a>). If you go to the hotels "Tryp Ciudad de Alicante" 
  	(no. 12 in the map), "Meliá" (no. 2 in the map) or "Spa Porta Maris" (no. 25 in the map) your 
  	stop is the last one: "Puerta del Mar", you'll see the big Spanish flag in the middle of a 
  	traffic rotary/roundabout. If you go to hotel "Rambla" (no. 20 in the map) or hotel "Tryp Gran 
  	Sol" (no. 3 in the map) your stop is "Portal de Elche" (the one before last). If you go to the 
  	hotel "Alfonso el Sabio" (no. 22 in the map) your stop is "Alfonso X el Sabio (Colmena)". The bus 
  	ride takes about 30 minutes and costs 1.05 euros.</p>
  	
  	<h4>Safety:</h4>
  	
  	<p>Summer in Spain means tons of tourists flock to our coastal resorts. This keeps our economy 
  	going (tourism is the most important industry in Spain and last year Spain displaced the Unites 
  	States as the world's second-favorite tourism destination. France holds the number one spot) but 
  	it also brings some inconveniences. The one that tourists are more likely to experience is 
  	pick-pocketing in and around touristic areas. This is especially acute in big cities like 
  	Barcelona and Madrid, but it never does any harm to use some precaution also in Alicante. Make 
  	sure your carry your wallet and purse in a safe location to avoid being pick-pocketed.</p>
