All authors who presented a poster or gave a talk are entitled to submit one paper to the 
proceedings volume which will also appear as a paper in the journal NeuroComputing. Based on 
past statistics we expect that less than 200 papers will be submitted so that no selection is 
needed.<b><font color="#ff0000"> We have send out instructions on how to submit by e-mail</font> 
(in case you did not receive our mail please contact chris@)</b> 
Electronic paper submission should be done no later than

CNS*2003 will be held in Alicante from Saturday, July 5, 2003 to
Wednesday, July 9. The main meeting will be July 5 - 7 at the Hotel
Meli&aacute (poster sessions) and at the CAM Cultural Center (oral presentations).
The main meeting consists of 6 oral sessions (one each morning and afternoon)
and 3 early evening poster sessions. Workshops will be held at the University
Miguel Hern&aacute;ndez (Medical School Campus) July 8 - 9. The conference dinner
will take place in the Santa B&aacute;rbara castle overlooking the city and the sea
on Sunday, July 6. <br>

<span class="titleltl"><strong>Call for papers :</strong><BR></span>
          Papers can include experimental, model-based, as well as more
abstract theoretical approaches to understanding neurobiological
computation.  We especially encourage papers that mix experimental
and theoretical studies.  We also accept papers that describe new
technical approaches to theoretical and experimental issues in
computational neuroscience or relevant software packages.</p>
The paper submission procedure is again completely electronic this year.<br>
</font>
<P>
<span class="titleltl"><strong>Paper Submission :</strong><BR></span>
Papers for the meeting can be submitted ONLY through this web site.
Papers can be submitted either as a 1000
word summary or as a full paper (max 6 typeset pages).  Full papers
stand a better chance of being accepted for oral presentation.  You
will need to submit the paper in pdf format (if necessary Elsevier can
help in converting your paper to pdf) and the 100 word abstract as
text.  You will also need to select two categories which describe
your paper and which will guide the selection of reviewers. In
addition we encourage you to also submit your paper to the 
<a href="http://www.computersciencepreprints.com">Elsevier preprint server</a>. 
All submissions will be acknowledged by email.<br>
<P>
<span class="titleltl"><strong>The Review Process :</strong><BR></span>
All submitted papers will be first reviewed by the program committee.
Papers will be judged and accepted for the meeting based on the
clarity with which the work is described and the biological relevance
of the research.  For this reason authors should be careful to make
the connection to biology clear.  We reject only a small fraction of
the papers (~ 5%) and this usually based on absence of biological
relevance (e.g. pure machine learning). We will notify authors of
meeting acceptance before end of March.
<P>
The second stage of review involves evaluation of submissions which
requested an oral presentation by two independent referees. In
addition to perceived quality as an oral presentation, the novelty of
the research and the diversity and coherence of the overall program
will be considered.  To ensure diversity, those who have given talks
in the recent past will not be selected and multiple oral
presentations from the same lab will be discouraged. All accepted
papers not selected for oral talks as well as papers explicitly
submitted as poster presentations will be included in one of three
evening poster sessions.  Authors will be notified of the
presentation format of their papers by begin of May.<BR>
<P>
<span class="titleltl"><strong>Conference Proceedings :</strong><BR></span>
The proceedings volume is published each year as a special supplement
to the journal Neurocomputing.  In addition the proceedings are
published in a hardbound edition by Elsevier Press.

Only 200 papers will be published in the proceedings volume. If more
than 200 papers are submitted (which is likely) the following rules
will apply: each presenting author (who has to register for the
meeting) can publish at most one paper in the proceedings book.  In
case of multi-author papers the same rule applies: one of the authors
is considered presenting author and this person has to register at
the meeting and cannot publish another paper.  If more than 200
presenting authors wish to publish their papers in the proceedings
volume the ranking based on the review process will be used to select
the top 200 papers.  Paper submissions to the conference proceedings
are a process separate from the current call for papers: a new
submission will need to be done in the early fall of 2003 for which
authors will receive detailed instructions.

For reference, papers presented at CNS*99 can be found in volumes
32-33 of Neurocomputing (2000), those of CNS*00 in volumes 38-40
(2001) and those of CNS*01 in volumes 44-46 (2002).</p>
