(Experiments were conducted on acute cerebellar slices of young \(11-16 days old\) rats. The ) '
(calcium-sensitive fluorescent indicator fluo-4 was introduced in the basket cell interneuron through ) '
(the patch-clamp pipette, at a concentration of 400 microM. Basket terminals were identified by co-) '
(localization of the two-photon basal fluorescence image of the presynaptic axon with the ) '
(transmitted light image of the Purkinje cell soma. We compared the properties of the presynaptic ) '
(action potential \(AP\) evoked calcium transients with those of the SCaTs obtained in the presence of ) '
(ryanodine. Calcium transients were analyzed in terms of the percentage change in fluorescence ) '
(with respect to the pre-stimulus period \(% DF/Fo\). In eight terminals, the calcium transients ) '
(induced by a train of 4 APs \(evoked by short intracellular depolarizations of the basket cell soma, at ) '
(50 Hz\) had an average peak amplitude of 239 ± 153 % \(mean ± s.d.\). Their decay was ) '
(approximated by a single exponential with average time constant of 3.6 ± 2.2 sec. In the same ) '
(terminals, after block of APs by tetrodotoxin, ryanodine \(5-10 microM\) highly increased the ) '
(frequency of SCaTs, suggesting that they are due to calcium release from intracellular stores, which ) '
(is facilitated at this concentration of ryanodine \(see Llano et al., Nature Neuroscience 2000\). Single ) '
(spontaneous events were characterized by a highly localized site of origin from which the signal ) '
(diffused into the neighboring axonal regions. The relative change in fluorescence was measured for ) '
(all pixels along the axonal tract and the source of the signal was identified as the site with the ) '
(fastest rise. The amplitude and decay time were measured at the source. The average SCaT ) '
(amplitude was 75 ± 16 %. The average decay \(through an exponential fit\) was 2.0 ± 0.8 sec. Larger ) '
(events with a complex rise phase were often observed and could be attributed to high frequency ) '
(bursts of summating single events. At each site of origin, SCaTs appeared to be clustered in time. ) '
(We computed the cumulative probability for the inter-event-intervals \(IEI\) at each site, starting ) '
(from the first event after ryanodine application. Most events \(70%\) had an IEI lower than 12 secs. ) '
(Our data indicates that there can be spontaneous calcium transients at the very terminals of basket ) '
(cell axons onto Purkinje cell somatas. These transients are due to intracellular store release of ) '
(calcium, a mechanism different from the conventional calcium entry during APs invasion of the ) '

(vesicular release.) '
