  	<h4>Conference Proceedings :</h4>
  	
  	<p>All authors who presented a poster or gave a talk are entitled to submit one paper to the 
  	proceedings volume which will also appear as a paper in the journal NeuroComputing. Based on past 
  	statistics we expect that less than 200 papers will be submitted so that no selection is 
  	needed. <b>We have send out instructions on how to submit by e-mail</b> (in case you did not 
  	receive our mail please contact chris). Electronic paper submission should be done no later than 
  	October 20, 2003.</p>

  	<p>CNS*2003 will be held in Alicante from Saturday, July 5, 2003 to Wednesday, July 9. The main 
  	meeting will be July 5 - 7 at the Hotel Meli&aacute; (poster sessions) and at the CAM Cultural 
  	Center (oral presentations). The main meeting consists of 6 oral sessions (one each morning and 
  	afternoon) and 3 early evening poster sessions. Workshops will be held at the University Miguel 
  	Hern&aacute;ndez (Medical School Campus) July 8 - 9. The conference dinner will take place in the 
  	Santa B&aacute;rbara castle overlooking the city and the sea on Sunday, July 6.</p>

  	<h4>Call for papers :</h4>
  	
  	<p>Papers can include experimental, model-based, as well as more abstract theoretical approaches 
  	to understanding neurobiological computation. We especially encourage papers that mix 
  	experimental and theoretical studies. We also accept papers that describe new technical 
  	approaches to theoretical and experimental issues in computational neuroscience or relevant 
  	software packages.</p>
  	
  	<p>The paper submission procedure is again completely electronic this year.</p>
  	
  	<h4>Paper Submission :</h4>
  	
  	<p>Papers for the meeting can be submitted ONLY through this web site. Papers can be submitted 
  	either as a 1000 word summary or as a full paper (max 6 typeset pages). Full papers stand a better 
  	chance of being accepted for oral presentation. You will need to submit the paper in pdf format 
  	(if necessary Elsevier can help in converting your paper to pdf) and the 100 word abstract as 
  	text.  You will also need to select two categories which describe your paper and which will guide 
  	the selection of reviewers. In addition we encourage you to also submit your paper to the 
  	<a href="http://www.computersciencepreprints.com">Elsevier preprint server</a>. All submissions 
  	will be acknowledged by email.</p>
  	
  	<h4>The Review Process :</h4>
  	
  	<p>All submitted papers will be first reviewed by the program committee. Papers will be judged 
  	and accepted for the meeting based on the clarity with which the work is described and the 
  	biological relevance of the research. For this reason authors should be careful to make the 
  	connection to biology clear.  We reject only a small fraction of the papers (~ 5%) and this 
  	usually based on absence of biological relevance (e.g. pure machine learning). We will notify 
  	authors of meeting acceptance before end of March.</p>
  	
  	<p>The second stage of review involves evaluation of submissions which requested an oral 
  	presentation by two independent referees. In addition to perceived quality as an oral 
  	presentation, the novelty of the research and the diversity and coherence of the overall program 
  	will be considered.  To ensure diversity, those who have given talks in the recent past will not 
  	be selected and multiple oral presentations from the same lab will be discouraged. All accepted 
  	papers not selected for oral talks as well as papers explicitly submitted as poster presentations 
  	will be included in one of three evening poster sessions. Authors will be notified of the 
  	presentation format of their papers by begin of May.</p>
  	
  	<h4>Conference Proceedings :</h4>
  	
  	<p>The proceedings volume is published each year as a special supplement to the journal 
  	Neurocomputing. In addition the proceedings are published in a hardbound edition by Elsevier 
  	Press.</p>
  	
  	<p>Only 200 papers will be published in the proceedings volume. If more than 200 papers are 
  	submitted (which is likely) the following rules will apply: each presenting author (who has to 
  	register for the meeting) can publish at most one paper in the proceedings book. In case of 
  	multi-author papers the same rule applies: one of the authors is considered presenting author and 
  	this person has to register at the meeting and cannot publish another paper. If more than 200 
  	presenting authors wish to publish their papers in the proceedings volume the ranking based on 
  	the review process will be used to select the top 200 papers. Paper submissions to the conference 
  	proceedings are a process separate from the current call for papers: a new submission will need 
  	to be done in the early fall of 2003 for which authors will receive detailed instructions.</p>
  	
  	<p>For reference, papers presented at CNS*99 can be found in volumes 32-33 of Neurocomputing 
  	(2000), those of CNS*00 in volumes 38-40 (2001) and those of CNS*01 in volumes 44-46 (2002).</p>
  	
  	<h4>Poster dimensions :</h4>
  	
  	<p>maximum 180*180cm!</p>
  	
  	<h4>Information and administration :</h4>
