<h2>Welcome to the CNS*2000 Review System!</h2>
</center>
<center><font color=red>
Please carefully review the following instructions for this year's<br> review which is somewhat different than previous years.
</font></center><br>



<blockquote>
<ul>

<li> REVIEWING ONLY FOR ORAL PRESENTATIONS:  This year the sole
purpose of your review is to identify those papers most appropriate for
oral presentation at the meeting.  All papers include here have already
been accepted at the meeting.  Accordingly, we are only asking you to
identify those papers that in your opinion would best be presented in 
oral
form.

<li>  THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW ORAL SLOTS AVAILABLE:  This year's
meeting has seen an almost 50% increase in submitted papers.  Of the 
340
papers submitted, approximately half have requested oral presentations.
The meeting schedule itself, however, can only accommodate 45 oral
presentations.  For this reason, we would ask you to apply the highest
possible standards to your vote for oral presentation.


<li> YOUR COMMENTS ARE IMPORTANT:  In addition to completing the
numerical evaluation, it will be particularly important this year that 
you
include more detailed and specific comments when appropriate.  The more
justification you give the program committee for papers you think 
should be
oral, the more likely the paper will be selected.


<li> FEATURED CONTRIBUTED TALKS: At the CNS meetings we now 
have a
special category of oral presentation called "Featured Contributed 
Talks".
These are papers submitted to the meeting that in the opinion of our
reviewers and the program committee are of suitable value and potential
interest to attendees that they should be given a full 50 minutes for
presentation.  It is particularly important that you justify any paper
nominated to this category.


</ul>

<p>
As always, on behalf of the program committee I want to thank you for
helping us out. Your contribution is very important to assuring a high
quality meeting.  I also hope to see you in Belgium in July. If
you have any questions about this process, the software, etc. do not
hesitate to contact me.
<p>
