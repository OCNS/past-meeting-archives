                     Tutorial Day
                     July 31, 1993 

Purpose:

	The tutorial day is intended to serve several 
purposes.  First, background presentations have been 
organized to provide an  opportunity for those unfamiliar 
with various aspects  of computational neuroscience to 
better enjoy the meeting.  Second, sessions have been 
organized to present and discuss technical issues of 
relevance to computational neuroscience.  Finally, there 
will be a general session with representatives of various 
federal funding agencies who provide support for 
computational neuroscience. All sessions will emphasize 
open discussions with participants.  Lunch will be 
provided as part of the tutorial registration fee.
