         support for travel


With support from the National Science Foundation,
the meeting organizers will be able to offer
some participants funds to attend the meeting.

Priority will be given to students and postdoctoral
fellows who are authors on papers.  However,
funds should be available for others as well.

While the total size of grants will depend on the
number of requests, last year the following
grants were given:

local (east coast this year)    $200
middle distance                 $300
distant (West coast, overseas)  $400

Last year, all requests were able to be honored.

Forms for travel grants will be filled out during
meeting registration and mailed within a month
of the end of the meeting.

------------------------------------------------
Please indicate interest in being considered for
travel grants on the registration form.

Those registered prior to July 1st, will be notified
about their awards during the first week of July.
Those registering in July will be notified at the
time of the meeting.

Early registration is advised for this reason.
