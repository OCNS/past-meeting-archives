       Registration information for the
   Second Annual Computation and Neural Systems 
                   Meeting
                   CNS*93

        July 31  through August 7,1993 
                Washington DC  

	This posting announces registration for this 
year's Computation and Neural Systems meeting 
(CNS*93).  This is the second in a series of annual 
inter-disciplinary conferences intended to address 
the broad range of research approaches and issues 
involved in the general field of computational 
neuroscience.  As last year, this meeting will bring 
together experimental and  theoretical 
neurobiologists along with engineers, computer 
scientists, cognitive scientists, physicists, and  
mathematicians  interested  in  understanding how 
biological neural systems compute.  The meeting will 
equally emphasize experimental, model-based,  and 
more abstract theoretical approaches to understanding 
neurobiological computation. 

        	Meeting Structure

	The meeting will be composed of three parts: a 
day of tutorials, three and a half days of research 
presentations, and two and a half days of follow up 
workshops.  The first day of the meeting (July 31) 
will be devoted to tutorial presentations and 
workshops focused on particular technical issues 
confronting computational neurobiology as well as 
general issues related to computational neurobiology. 
Introductory tutorials will also be given. The next 
three and a half days will include the main technical 
program consisting of plenary, contributed and poster 
sessions.  Oral presentations will be made in one 
continuous session.  Posters will be presented each 
evening.  Following the main meeting, there will be 
two and a half days of focused workshops at a resort 
in West Virginia. Workshop topics will be established 
via email communication prior to the meeting as well as  
during the main meeting based on papers presented and 
issues raised. 

	            Location

	The tutorial day and the main meeting itself 
will be held at the Hyatt Regency Bethesda.  This 
modern hotel is located at One Bethesda Metro Center 
in downtown Bethesda with  easy access to the DC 
metro system.  Following the main meeting, two days 
of postmeeting workshops will be held at the Coolfont 
resort which is set within 1350 mountainous acres in the 
Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia.
