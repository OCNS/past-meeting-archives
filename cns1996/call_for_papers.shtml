  	<h2>The Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting</h2>
  	
  	<h3>July 14 - 17, 1996, Cambridge, Massachusetts</h3>
  	
  	<h4>CNS*1996 Call for Papers</h4>
  	
  	<p>This is the fifth annual meeting of an interdisciplinary conference intended to address the 
  	broad range of research approaches and issues involved in the field of computational neuroscience. 
  	The last four annual meetings, in San Francisco (CNS*92), Washington, DC (CNS*93), and Monterey, 
  	California (CNS*94, CNS*95) brought experimental and theoretical neurobiologists along with 
  	engineers, computer scientists, cognitive scientists, physicists, and mathematicians together to 
  	consider the functioning of biological nervous systems. Peer reviewed papers were presented on a 
  	range of subjects related to understanding how nervous systems compute.</p>
  	
  	<p>As in previous years, the meeting will equally emphasize experimental, model-based, and more 
  	abstract theoretical approaches to understanding neurobiological computation. The meeting in 1996 
  	will take place at the Cambridge Center Marriott and include plenary, contributed and poster 
  	sessions. There will be no parallel sessions and the full text of presented papers will be 
  	published in a proceedings volume. A series of informal workshops will be interspersed with the 
  	regular meeting sessions, allowing discussion of current issues in computational neuroscience.</p>
  	
  	<p>With this announcement we solicit the submission of presented papers. All papers will be 
  	refereed. Authors should send original research contributions in the form of a 1000-word (or 
  	less) summary and a separate single page 50-100 word abstract clearly stating their results. 
  	Summaries are for program committee use only. Abstracts will be published in the conference 
  	program. At the bottom of each abstract page and on the first summary page, indicate preference 
  	for oral or poster presentation and specify at least one appropriate category and theme from the 
  	following list:</p>

  	correspondence author only. Submissions will not be considered if they lack category information, 
  	separate abstract sheets, author addresses, or are late.</p>
  	
  	<p>Submissions can be made by surface mail ONLY by sending 6 copies of the abstract and summary
