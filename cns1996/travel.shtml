  	<h2>The Annual Computational Neuroscience Meeting</h2>
  	
  	<h3>July 14 - 17, 1996, Cambridge, Massachusetts</h3>
  	
  	<h4>CNS*1996 Travel, food and lodging</h4>
  	
  	<p>The CNS*96 Meeting site is the Cambridge Center Marriott Hotel in Kendall Square, Cambridge, 
  	Massachusetts. For those of you who may not know, Cambridge is right across the Charles River 
  	from Boston, and all flight arrangements should be made for Boston's Logan Airport. The hotel is 
  	directly adjacent to the Kendall Square subway stop on the Red Line, and is across the street 
  	from MIT. From the airport, the hotel can be reached by taxi (about 20 dollars -- 20 minutes with 
  	light traffic).</p>
  	
  	<p>The hotel can also be reached by taking the subway. In Boston the subway is known as the "T", 
  	and currently (4/96) costs $0.85 for most rides. At the airport, take a shuttle bus to the subway 
  	station, then take the Blue Line "inbound" to Government Center. Change at Government Center to 
  	the Green Line inbound. Take the Green Line (any train) to Park Street and change to the Red 
  	Line. Take the Red Line outbound to Kendall Square. The whole trip should take about 45 minutes. 
  	Subway system maps are sometimes available at the information booth at the Park Street station.</p>
  	
  	<p>Details are as follows:</p>
  	
  	<p>Cambridge Center Marriott, Two Cambridge Center, Corner of Broadway and Third Street, 
  	Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02142. Reservations can be made at 1-800-228-9290 or (617) 494-6600.</p>
  	
  	<h4>Hotel Rates</h4>
  	
  	<p>The Hotel management has been extremely generous in giving us highly discounted rates for 
  	their rooms during their peak tourist season. ALL RATES ARE "ROOM" RATES AND ALL ROOMS CAN HAVE 
  	UP TO FOUR PEOPLE (thus if you are sharing a room you may only end up paying a fraction of the 
  	figures below). In all cases, extra "cots" can be put in the rooms, if you want to save even more 
  	money.</p>
  	
  	<ul>
  	  <li>student attendees: <b>$ 99</b> per room per day</li>
  	  <li>non-student attendees: <b>$126</b> per room per day</li>
  	  <li>Government attendees: <b>$ 86</b> per (single) room per day<br />
  	  (you must work for an agency such as NIH or NSF to get the government rate)</li>
  	</ul>
  	
  	<p><b>In order to get these rates you must make your reservation by June 12, 1995!</b></p>
  	
  	<p>You must make your reservations directly with the hotel, and guarantee them with a credit 
  	card. YOU MUST IDENTIFY YOUR AFFILIATION WITH THE MEETING TO GET THE SPECIAL RATES!!!!! When 
  	making reservations by phone, make sure and indicate that you are registering for the CNS*96 
  	meeting. Students will be asked to verify their status on check in with a student ID or other 
  	documentation.</p>
  	
  	<p>The conference is Sunday, July 14th through Wednesday July 17th. We suggest that you book a 
  	room from the evening of Saturday, July 13th though the evening of Wednesday, July 17th 
  	inclusive.</p>

  	<h4>Student Housing</h4>
  	
  	<p>For student registrants, 14 single occupancy rooms are available on the Harvard University 
  	campus at a total of $148 for all FOUR nights. Due to the limited number of rooms, do NOT assume 
  	you have received housing until you are notified that you have.</p>
  	
  	<p>You must agree to arrive during a brief check-in period arranged with Harvard (July 13, 6 - 8 
  	p.m.) and check out on July 17 (6 -8 p.m). We cannot guarantee access to keys if you miss the 
  	check-in. The rooms have single beds and private bathrooms, but do not have telephones. Rooms are 
  	on the undergraduate Harvard campus in Cambridge (a 15 minute subway ride from the conference 
  	location at Kendall Square). To register for these rooms e-mail your request to Judy Macias. 
  	Please note that the housing requests will be on a first-come-first-served basis. (We will not 
  	accept smaller payments for shorter stays, since the conference must pay for the full time period 
  	for each room).</p>
  	
  	<h4>Day Care</h4>
  	
  	<p>Day care will be available at the conference for those who inform us in advance of their day 
  	care needs. Please send e-mail with</p>
  	
  	<ul>
  	  <li>name of parent(s),</li>
  	  <li>e-mail address,</li>
  	  <li>name of children requiring day care,</li>
  	  <li>age of children, and</li>
  	  <li>estimated times during which children will need day care.</li>
  	</ul>
  	
  	<p>Day care will be available from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday to Wednesday. Note that day care will 
  	not be provided during the evening.</p>
